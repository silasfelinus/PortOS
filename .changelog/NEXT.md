# Unreleased Changes

## Added

- **[versioning-diff-view-per-stage-persist-last-n] Pipeline text stages now keep a version history.** Each regenerate snapshots the prior draft (up to five back) and a new "History" button on the Idea / Prose / Comic Script / Teleplay editors opens a side-by-side word diff against the current version with one-click restore.

## Changed

- **[cover-prose-input-idea-input-in-canonusage-corpus] Universe canon cross-reference test suite now pins every stage the per-issue search reads** — a regression that silently drops a stage from the search now fails the test suite immediately.
- **[extract-shared-requiretoolkit-helper] Internal: consolidated three duplicated AI toolkit accessors into one shared module.** No behavior change; cuts ~30 lines and makes future toolkit-state changes one-touch.
- **[codex5-bundle-lazy-routes] Dashboard widgets load on demand.** A dashboard layout now only downloads the widgets it actually uses — the first paint of a slimmed-down layout no longer drags in every widget in the registry, and slow widgets render their own placeholder while loading instead of blocking sibling cells. Also adds an `npm run build:analyze` script for inspecting bundle composition during development.

## Fixed

- **[feeds-ssrf-ipv6-bracket-hostname-gap] RSS feed subscriptions now reliably reject IPv6 loopback, link-local, and unique-local addresses** — previously the loopback `http://[::1]/feed` case was blocked only incidentally by DNS errors; subscribing to feeds at literal private IPv6 addresses is now refused outright, including IPv4-mapped variants like `[::ffff:192.168.1.1]`.
- **[legacy-series-canon-orphan-universe-leak-on-throw] Retrying a failed peer-share import no longer leaves empty "(auto-migrated)" universes behind** — when a transient disk error interrupted importing a peer's series, each retry used to mint a fresh empty universe; the importer now reuses the same one across retries so the import either lands cleanly or is harmless to retry.

## Removed
