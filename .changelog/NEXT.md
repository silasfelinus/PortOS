# Release vNEXT

Released: TBD

## Overview

TBD

## Added

- **Unified Story Builder** (`/story-builder`): a new guided page that walks a story from idea → universe aesthetic → plot arc → reader map → characters → issues → production as one linear flow. Each step is LLM-assisted with an AI-refinement affordance and ends with an explicit lock before the next unlocks; going back to revise an earlier step soft-flags the downstream locked steps as "stale" (integrity gate) so nothing silently drifts — without destroying their content. The builder is a thin conductor over the existing Universe / Series / Issue records (no data duplication); heavy per-issue production hands off to the existing Pipeline issue page. Reachable from the sidebar (Create → Story Builder), ⌘K, and voice. The intro screen supports two intake modes: **start from a seed idea**, or **import a finished work** (comic script / screenplay / novel / short story) — the importer reverse-engineers it into a universe, arc, characters, and issues, then drops you into the wizard to review and lock each stage.
- **Reader Map** on a series arc (`series.arc.readerMap`): a distinct audience-experience roadmap — hooks, payoffs, emotional beats, and cliffhangers across the arc — built on top of the Vonnegut story shape, separate from the protagonist arc. Generated and refined via the new Story Builder reader-map step (also preserved by arc regeneration).

## Changed

## Fixed

- Series detail page: when the Story Bible drawer is open, the Series Arc + Editorial Roadmap split and the inner text + 260px Themes panel split now respond to the actual content-area width instead of viewport width. Switched to Tailwind v4 container queries — Roadmap drops below Arc when the content area is < 1024px, and Themes stacks below the logline/summary column when the Arc card is < 672px, preventing the text column from being squeezed into an unreadable strip.
