# Unreleased

## Added

- Voice assistant gained new tools: ask for today's calendar, your next event, the current weather, set a timer, and log a workout by voice — plus "what's on this chart?" which screenshots the active tab and describes it with a vision model.
- Voice assistant now pulls in relevant long-term memories when you ask recall-style questions ("what did I decide about…", "do I prefer…"), so answers draw on what it already knows about you.
- Video metadata (the `video-history.json` rows) now syncs between federated machines alongside the video files, so a shared collection's video items render on the receiving machine instead of showing up as missing. Thumbnails are regenerated on arrival.
- The Universes sidebar entry now expands into per-universe sub-links, matching the Series Pipeline section.

## Changed

- The image lightbox now shows the "Syncing…" placeholder and swaps in the real image the moment it arrives from a peer, instead of showing a broken image during the sync window.
- The ⌘K command palette no longer shows two ambiguous "Health" rows — the MeatSpace one is now "Body Health".
- Reverse subscriptions created during peer sync now update the Instances page live, without a manual refresh.

## Fixed

- Peer sync no longer suppresses an entire category's snapshot for a machine that only subscribes to some records — edits to your other universes/series now reach that peer, and a previously-shared record that's marked ephemeral and then deleted now propagates its deletion.
- A delete that failed to reach a peer can no longer have its tombstone garbage-collected early, which previously let the deleted record resurrect on the next sync.
- Re-importing a share bucket that resurrects a locally-deleted record now notifies peers, and the importer no longer treats a locally-deleted universe as permanently "missing".
- Remixing a video clip whose original model has since been uninstalled now tells you it fell back to the default model, instead of silently switching.
- MeatSpace iCloud writes retry on a couple more transient filesystem errors (EBUSY/EIO) that busy iCloud paths can throw.

## Internal

- The voice UI index now ships the page's visible-text only when the assistant actually needs it (on demand), trimming per-turn payload size.
- Extracted a shared `.env` parse/upsert helper for the setup scripts; migrated a duplicated byte-formatter to the shared one.
- Added a global test setup that prevents test-created records from fanning out to live sync peers, plus assorted hardening to the video render helper and TUI session handler.
