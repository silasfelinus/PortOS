# Unreleased Changes

## Added

- **Universe canon — characters, places, and objects on the universe.** Phase A
  of the Universe-as-canon refactor. `universe.characters[]`/`settings[]`/
  `objects[]` arrays now live on the universe record alongside the existing
  prompt-template categories (additive — existing universes load with empty
  canon arrays). New routes:
  - `POST /api/universe-builder/:id/extract-canon` — pulls characters/places/
    objects from a prose body and merges into canon. Mirrors the series-side
    bible extractor.
  - `POST /api/universe-builder/:id/characters/:entryId/refine` — single-
    character rewrite (same prompt as the series-side refine).
  - `POST /api/universe-builder/:id/characters/differentiate-cast` — one LLM
    call rewrites every character's `physicalDescription` to push the entire
    cast apart on ethnicity/age/build/hair/wardrobe so no two characters
    render visually interchangeable. New prompt template
    `pipeline-character-differentiate-cast.md`.

  A new **Canon** page (`/universe-builder/:universeId/canon`) accessed via
  the Library button on the Universe Builder header surfaces all three
  operations + per-entity reference renders + click-to-preview thumbnails.
  Shared `CanonCard` component used by both the Universe Canon page and the
  per-series Nouns page (the per-series view stays alive until Phase B
  migrates series.cast → universe references).

  Image-delete now purges canon refs from both the series store AND the
  universe store, so deleting a reference image from the gallery cleans both.

- **Pipeline Issue — merged Comic Pages tab.** Comic Script + Comic Pages are
  now one tab labeled *Comic Pages*. Each row is a per-page editable markdown
  textarea on the left and the rendered full-page comic image on the right.
  Generating from prose auto-splits the script into pages. Panels are still
  parsed internally so the image prompt stays high-quality, but the
  panel-level UI is gone — the user only sees pages. A new
  `PATCH /pipeline/issues/:id/stages/comicPages/pages/:pageIndex` endpoint
  accepts an edited `rawText` and re-parses panels. The comic-script parser
  now emits a per-page `rawText` slice; legacy pages without one fall back to
  reconstructing markdown from their structured panels, so existing series
  don't lose data.

- **LLM provider+model picker on issue pages.** The `SeriesLlmPicker` from
  the arc header is now also rendered at the top of every issue stage page
  (idea / prose / comic / TV script / etc.), bound to the same `series.llm`
  field. Idea generation, prose generation, comic-script generation, and
  auto-run-text all thread the choice into their `providerId` / `model`
  payloads. Changing the provider on one page updates it everywhere.

- **Codex CLI assistant-reply extractor.** New `server/lib/codexAssistantExtract.js`
  carves out just the assistant reply from Codex's full session transcript
  (banner + metadata + echoed prompt + `codex\n<reply>` + `tokens used: ...`
  footer). Applied unconditionally in `stageRunner.js` — idempotent for
  non-Codex providers. Text stages no longer ship the whole transcript in
  their output; JSON stages get a cleaner walker input as a side benefit.
  Fixes prior runs where comicScript / prose / idea outputs captured the
  banner + echoed prompt alongside the real response.

- **Pipeline Issue — answer-and-refine flow for beat-sheet open questions.**
  The idea stage prompt now tells the LLM to commit to decisive choices
  rather than hedging — `## Open questions` is OPTIONAL and only used when
  something fundamentally needs user input the LLM can't infer from the
  bible. When the section does appear, the idea page renders a panel below
  the output with one input per question and a *Refine with answers* button
  that re-runs the stage with the answers folded into the seed and
  instructions to drop the open-questions section in the revision. Blank
  answers tell the LLM to commit to its own best guess on that item.

- **Pipeline Series — configurable per-series AI provider + model.** The arc
  header now has provider + model dropdowns (mirroring the World Builder
  expansion picker) bound to a new `series.llm = { provider, model }` field.
  The choice persists on the series and is threaded into every arc operation —
  Generate / Regenerate arc, Verify arc, Resolve, and per-season Generate
  episodes — so the whole arc workflow runs against one consistent provider.
  Defaults to the active system provider when unset.

- **Pipeline Series — granular continuity context for season generation and
  verification.** When generating volume N's episode breakdown, the LLM now
  receives the actual per-episode beats of all prior volumes (pulled from each
  issue's `stages.idea.input`), not just the season-level synopses. The
  Verify arc pass also sees those per-episode synopses, so it can finally
  catch contradictions like "S1E7 introduces a character never referenced
  again" or "S2E3 implies a state S1's final episode hasn't reached" — the
  prompt has always asked for these checks, but with only episode titles
  visible the LLM had to bluff.

- **Pipeline Series — automatic bible extraction after generation.** After a
  successful per-season *Generate episodes* run, the server now extracts new
  characters / settings / objects mentioned in the new episode loglines and
  synopses, deduplicates them against the existing bible, and merges them in.
  The same extraction also fires after every successful prose-stage
  generation (`stages.prose`). Result: characters introduced mid-writing flow
  back into the series bible automatically, so downstream visual stages
  render the same character consistently across issues. Toast on the
  episodes-generate flow now reads `"Generated 11 episodes (+3 chars, +2
  settings, +1 objects extracted)"`.

- **Pipeline Series — character physical descriptions reach image
  composers.** `composeComicPagePrompt` and `composeVisualPrompt` now receive
  the matched character profiles for everyone speaking on the page or named
  in a storyboard scene's description, and prepend a "Featuring — NAME:
  <physicalDescription>; ..." clause to the diffusion prompt. A new
  `matchCharactersInText` helper word-boundary-scans free-text scene
  descriptions for bible character names + aliases (the comic-page path uses
  the structured dialogue character field directly). Same character now
  renders the same way across panels, pages, and scenes.

- **Pipeline Series — auto-resolve verification findings.** The verify panel
  now has a *Resolve all* button at the top and a per-finding *Resolve* button
  on each row. Each kicks off an LLM pass that rewrites the arc + volume
  outlines (logline, summary, synopses, episode-count targets) to address the
  selected finding(s) and persists the result. Per-issue scripts are never
  touched. New stage prompt `pipeline-arc-resolve` and route
  `POST /pipeline/series/:id/arc/resolve-issues`.

- **Pipeline Series — recommended-structure hint.** The *Target issues /
  episodes* field shows a live suggestion next to it ("3 volumes × 8
  episodes", etc.) computed from comic-as-TV norms: 1 volume for ≤ 12, 2 for
  13–17, 3 for 18–32, 4 for 33–44, 5 beyond. The arc-overview LLM prompt now
  receives the same recommendation so it stops slicing 12-issue runs into
  three 4-issue seasons.

- **Pipeline Series — linked World context flows into arc planning.** The
  arc-overview, verify, resolve, and season-episode-breakdown prompts now
  receive the linked World Builder world's full entity set (categories like
  factions / characters / environments / artifacts + composite reference
  sheets + influences). The LLM is instructed to ground every volume's
  logline and synopsis in those entities by name rather than inventing
  parallel ones, and the verify pass flags arc references that don't exist
  in the world (or major world entities that go entirely unused).

- **Pipeline Series — auto-flush bible state before LLM actions.** Clicking
  *Regenerate arc*, *Verify arc*, *Resolve all*, or *Resolve* now first
  pushes any pending local bible edits (issue count target, logline,
  premise, etc.) to the server so the LLM runs against the on-screen state
  rather than the last manually-saved snapshot.

- **Pipeline — Nouns stage between Prose and Comic.** New UI-only tab that
  surfaces, per-issue, the characters / settings / objects appearing in the
  prose. Each entry shows its canonical description and an `imageRefs[]`
  thumbnail strip with a *Render reference* button that fires a styled image
  gen and pins the resulting filename onto the series bible — so the
  comic-page renderer (which now cites those rich descriptions in its prompt)
  keeps characters and settings visually consistent across pages without
  having to pass actual reference images (which Codex's `$imagegen` doesn't
  accept). Extract from prose lives here now too; removed from the Prose tab.
  Reference renders inherit the linked world's `stylePrompt` + `negativePrompt`
  via `composeStyledPrompt`, so the aesthetic stays consistent with comic pages.
  The card defers the series PATCH until the job's `useMediaJobProgress`
  reports `completed`, so the UI never tries to load a not-yet-written
  `/data/images/<jobId>.png`.

- **Comic page renderer — cite settings + objects in the prompt, not just
  characters.** `enqueueVisualComicPage` now builds the matched bible set
  from the union of dialogue CAPS speakers and panel description / caption /
  SFX prose. `composeComicPagePrompt` emits new `Setting — <name>: …, palette,
  recurring details` and `Notable — <name>: <description>` clauses alongside
  the existing `Featuring —` clause. Fixes the case where a panel like
  "Wren pins the navy woman's wrist against the pavement" rendered with the
  model re-improvising both subjects every time because dialogue-only
  matching never saw them. New `matchSettingsInText` + `matchObjectsInText`
  mirror the character matcher; all three share a private
  `matchEntriesByCandidates` helper.

- **Pipeline image-gen — DRY settings form + codex-by-default for comic
  pages.** New `ImageGenSettingsForm` component bundles the backend chip
  strip + per-model controls + style textareas behind a single
  `{value, onChange}` contract; reused by the Comic Pages tab and the new
  Nouns tab. Settings persist to `settings.pipeline.imageGen` and default to
  Codex whenever the system has `imageGen.codex.enabled === true`, matching
  the recommendation that cloud models render comic pages dramatically
  better than local diffusion. Default resolution is now `1024×1536`
  (2:3 portrait, the closest preset to a real comic-book trim) instead of
  `1024×1024`. Right-side `Drawer` opened via a header gear button.

- **Pipeline image-gen — seed support for comic page + scene renders.**
  `comicPageRenderSchema` and `visualGenerateSchema` (server) now accept
  `seed`, and `enqueueImageJob` threads it into the queued job params.
  Client form exposes a seed input + random-dice button. Local mflux and
  diffusers runners honor it; codex still picks its own.

- **Series bible — `imageRefs[]` on settings and objects.** Previously
  characters-only; the Nouns stage's *Render reference* button writes to all
  three. Pipeline route schemas already use `.passthrough()`, so the client
  PATCH round-trips cleanly through the canonical sanitizer with no other
  schema changes.

## Changed

- **Data migration scripts for bringing old machines forward.** Two new
  scripts under `server/scripts/`:
  - `migrateWorldToUniverse.js` — renames `data/world-builder.json` →
    `data/universe-builder.json`, the top-level `worlds[]` → `universes[]`
    key, every `"worldId":` → `"universeId":` in `pipeline-series.json`,
    and every `"worldRun":` → `"universeRun":` in `media-jobs.json`. Safe
    to re-run (idempotent).
  - `migrateAll.js` — chains world→universe naming (above) and then
    series-canon → universe-canon in the correct order. The single
    command other machines need to catch up to the current schema.

  Run with `node server/scripts/migrateAll.js --dry-run` first to preview;
  drop `--dry-run` to apply.

  Also fixed a bug in `migrateSeriesCanon.js` where the migration was a
  no-op because `mergeExtractedBible` mutates its first arg (pushes into
  it) — the post-merge length comparison was always equal. Now clones the
  universe-side array before passing.

- **Pipeline render paths read canon from the linked universe (Phase B).**
  Comic-page, panel, storyboard, and arc-planner LLM contexts now resolve
  characters/places/objects via `getSeriesCanon(series)` — preferring the
  series's linked universe canon and falling back to the series's own arrays
  only when the universe isn't migrated yet. Switching the source of truth
  to the universe is the prerequisite for crossover series sharing a cast.

  Migration utility: `node server/services/pipeline/migrateSeriesCanon.js`
  (optional `--dry-run`) copies each series's
  `series.{characters,settings,objects}[]` into its linked universe via
  `mergeExtractedBible` (dedup by name). Idempotent. Auto-creates a
  universe for orphan series. Does NOT clear the series arrays — they stay
  as a pre-migration fallback until Phase B.2 drops the schema fields.

  Fallback is **all-or-nothing per series**: if a series has any kind
  populated locally that the universe hasn't received yet, we read the
  whole series-side canon (rather than mixing universe characters with
  series settings and producing silent hybrid stale data).

  Phase B.2 (next): point the per-issue Nouns page directly at universe
  canon, remove series-side bible arrays from the schema, drop the
  legacy `extractAndMergeIntoSeries` + `refineCharacterDescription`
  functions.

- **BREAKING — World Builder is now Universe Builder.** A universe can contain
  many worlds, and stories within the same universe can share canon (characters,
  places, things) across multiple series — Marvel-style crossovers. This is a
  pure rename pass; behavior is unchanged. Files (`worldBuilder*.js` →
  `universeBuilder*.js`, `WorldBuilder.jsx` → `UniverseBuilder.jsx`), routes
  (`/api/world-builder/*` → `/api/universe-builder/*`), client routes
  (`/world-builder` → `/universe-builder`), fields (`series.worldId` →
  `series.universeId`), top-level data key (`worlds: []` → `universes: []` in
  `data/universe-builder.json`), function names (`getWorld` → `getUniverse`,
  etc.), constants (`WORLD_ID_MAX` → `UNIVERSE_ID_MAX`), and the
  `params.worldRun` mediaJobQueue tag (148 existing job records migrated).
  Back-compat: the `⌘K` palette + voice agent keep `'world'`/`'world-builder'`
  as aliases for the renamed nav entry, so muscle memory still resolves.
  Sets up the next phase: lift canon entities (characters/places/objects)
  from per-series bibles to the universe so multiple series can share them.

- **Pipeline character — "AI: differentiate" button.** Per-character refine on
  the Nouns page (Universe Builder side coming). Sends the target plus every
  peer's `physicalDescription` to a new `pipeline-character-refine` prompt
  and rewrites only the target's `physicalDescription` so no two characters
  collide on ethnicity, age, hair, silhouette, or signature wardrobe.
  Preserves evidence + firstAppearance.

- **Character extraction prompt — opinionated commits, not gaps.**
  `writers-room-characters.md` now requires every renderable axis (ethnicity,
  age decade, build, hair color/length/texture/style, eye color, distinguishing
  facial features, signature wardrobe with palette + era, posture). When prose
  is silent, the LLM is told to COMMIT to a specific choice that differentiates
  the character from the rest of the cast and log the committed axes in
  `missingFromProse[]`. The old "do not invent" rule was producing
  visually-interchangeable characters when prose was sparse on visual specifics.

- **Sidebar Pipeline submenu — all series, not 10 recent issues.** The
  Create → Pipeline grandchildren now list every series alphabetically
  (links to `/pipeline/series/:id`) instead of the 10 most recently updated
  issues. Series-level entries stay coherent across many series — individual
  issues live under their series page. Sort happens in the fetch effect so
  the memoized nav tree doesn't re-sort when unrelated `sidebarApps` state
  changes.

- **Comic-page image prompts — balloon lettering rule.** `composeComicPagePrompt`
  in `server/services/pipeline/visualStages.js` now formats each dialogue
  line as `Speech balloon reads: "<text>" (spoken by NAME[, balloon style: <hint>])`
  and translates `(EARPIECE)` / `(WHISPERED)` / `(THOUGHT)` parentheticals
  into visual styling hints. The page-layout clause explicitly tells the
  diffusion model to letter ONLY the quoted text — speaker names and
  parentheticals were previously being lettered verbatim inside balloons.

- **Prose stage — present tense, non-negotiable.** `data.sample/prompts/stages/pipeline-prose.md`
  now demands present tense throughout so the upstream draft matches the
  downstream comic and TV-script adaptations, keeping visual beats
  translatable across formats.

- **Comic-script stage — target a standard 22-page issue.** The comic-script
  prompt now anchors on the industry-standard 22-page count (100–140 panels)
  and tells the LLM to expand action across more panels when the prose draft
  is short rather than cutting page count.

- **Pipeline nav — shorter tab labels.** *Comic Pages* → *Comic*,
  *Episode Video* → *Video*. The full names were redundant inside the
  Pipeline page where every tab is obviously a pipeline stage.

- **Pipeline Series — Regenerate arc button no longer requires two clicks.**
  Dropped the `useArmedAction` two-click-arm pattern from the regenerate
  button; one click runs. The pattern was confusing — users didn't realize
  "Click again to replace" was an instruction rather than a status. The
  delete-season and delete-issue buttons keep the arm pattern since they're
  hover-revealed trash icons where misclick risk is real.

- **Pipeline Series — combined comic/TV terminology.** Every series now ships
  in both formats by default — graphic novel (issues → volumes) AND TV
  (episodes → seasons). Dropped the *Target format* picker from the new-
  series form and the bible sidebar; all labels read as `issues / episodes`
  and `volumes / seasons` so a single record drives both pipelines. The
  arc-overview / verify / resolve prompts were rewritten to author for both
  formats simultaneously.

- **Pipeline Series — flush-edge layout.** The series detail page now uses
  the same edge-to-edge canvas as World Builder. The bible sidebar sits flush
  against the main app sidebar (no Layout padding between them) and the
  collapse rail is a plain hairline toggle instead of a floating rounded
  button.

- **World Builder — inline Refine prompts.** Clicking *Refine prompts* now
  expands a feedback textarea right under the header buttons instead of
  opening a modal. The LLM picked in the page's own provider/model selectors
  is used directly (no second selector), and the refined output is applied
  straight to the prompt fields below so you can see the changes in place. A
  short rationale + change list appears below the textarea after each refine.

- **World Builder — explicit-removal handling in Refine.** When the user
  feedback names a specific variation or composite to remove, the LLM is now
  told to omit it entirely (including composite sheets whose primary subject
  is the removed entity, e.g. a "Faction A vs Faction B branding sheet") and
  to scrub stray references from sibling unlocked composites' prompts.

## Fixed

- **Media Jobs Queue — empty prompt tooltip.** Job rows without a prompt
  no longer render an empty `title=""` tooltip. Rows with a prompt now
  show the full prompt on hover (the visible cell is still truncated to
  80 chars).

- **Codex image gen — "Codex returned no session id" false negative.** With
  long pipeline prompts (multi-KB comic-script payloads), codex emits the
  banner + echoed prompt in a single stderr chunk that exceeds the
  banner-scan buffer. The old `captureSession()` sliced the buffer's tail
  before running the regex, chopping the `session id:` line off the front
  and failing every render. Now matches before slicing, and stops feeding
  stdout into the banner buffer so an interleaved stdout chunk can't split
  the session-id line either. Adds regression tests for both paths.

## Removed

- **Dead `listRecentPipelineIssues` client API.** Sidebar no longer fetches
  recent issues, so the corresponding `apiPipeline.js` wrapper is removed.
  The server route + tests stay for now in case future surfaces want it.
