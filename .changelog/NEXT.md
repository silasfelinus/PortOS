# Release vNEXT

Released: TBD

## Overview

TBD

## Added

- **Use a different Chrome variant for the PortOS-managed browser.** PortOS now reads a `chromePath` (and `macAppBundle` on macOS) from `data/browser-config.json`, so you can point it at Chrome Canary, Chromium, Brave, Edge, or any Chromium-based browser — separating the automation surface from your daily-driver Chrome. Setup (`./setup.sh` / `setup.ps1`) and update (`./update.sh` / `./update.ps1`) now offer to install and configure Chrome Canary automatically: on macOS via `brew install --cask google-chrome@canary`, on Windows via `winget install Google.Chrome.Canary`. The prompt is interactive-only (CI / non-TTY runs skip silently), idempotent (won't re-prompt once configured), and supports `PORTOS_USE_CANARY=1` for headless opt-in. The Browser page's Config panel exposes both fields for after-the-fact edits.

## Changed

- **Dashboard Quick Image widget** — now exposes **resolution** and **negative prompt** options (collapsible) alongside the prompt, and renders the result inline: async backends stream the diffusion loading animation (spinner / step counter / latent preview) and resolve to the final image, mirroring the Universe asset slots via the shared `MediaJobThumb`. Sync (external) backends show the completed image directly. The "Edit" hand-off now carries the chosen size + negative prompt into the full Image Gen page.

- **Universes table** — each row now shows a 48×48 thumbnail of the latest image from the universe's auto-managed media collection (the `Universe: <name>` bucket linked by `collection.universeId`). Rows without media fall back to a Globe placeholder; a broken file ref also degrades to the placeholder via `<img onError>`. Applies to both the desktop table and the mobile card layout.

- **Writers Room auto-collapses the header + library when you open a work.** Tapping a library item now collapses both the page header and the library so the editor gets the full screen — most useful on mobile, where the library is an inline block stacked above the editor. The header shrinks to a slim bar that hosts the "show library" control (reachable on mobile, where there was previously no expand affordance), and the library always re-appears whenever no work is selected so you're never stranded.

## Fixed

- **TUI agents no longer try (and fail) to `/quit` at the end of a run.** The spawned-agent completion workflow used to tell the agent to write its `.agent-done` sentinel and then run `/quit`. In current Claude Code, `/quit` is a UI command that can't be invoked programmatically — so the agent attempted `Skill(quit)`, hit an error, and printed a confusing "please run /quit yourself" message before idling. The prompt now treats the sentinel as the sole done signal (PortOS finalizes the run within 2s of seeing it and closes the session itself) and explicitly tells the agent not to run `/quit`.
- **Tabbed sub-nav strips no longer drift vertically on mobile.** The horizontally-scrolling sub-nav tabs (Media Gen and every other page that uses the shared `TabPills` primitive) could be dragged diagonally/vertically on iOS, producing an uneven, wonky scroll. Both `TabPills` scroll containers now set `touch-action: pan-x` so touch gestures pan the strip horizontally while vertical drags pass through to normal page scrolling.
- **Chief of Staff pane overflow** — content panel collapses to a single `flex-1 min-h-0 min-w-0 overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` div so tall tab content scrolls inside the panel instead of expanding it. Event log rows in both `EventLog` and `TerminalCoSPanel` get `break-all` so long unbreakable tokens (URLs, hashes, paths) wrap inside the 320px sidebar instead of pushing the column wider visually.
- **Videos now load in the Media Gen preview on mobile.** Both the preview-modal (lightbox) `<video>` and the Video Gen page's inline result preview autoplayed unmuted, which iOS/Android block outside a direct user gesture — so the clip never started and the area showed only black ("not loading"). They now play `muted` (autoplay-eligible everywhere; controls let you unmute) and render the thumbnail as a `poster`, so the frame is visible immediately even while the clip buffers.
- **Video previews now play with sound on mobile.** Opening a video from Media Gen history previously stayed silent because the muted-autoplay baseline (needed so the clip loads at all on iOS/Android) was never upgraded to audible. The lightbox now unmutes and re-plays on open — the opening tap's user activation lets iOS grant audible playback — and falls back to muted if the browser blocks it, so the clip always runs and the controls can unmute it manually.
