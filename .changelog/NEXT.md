# Release vNEXT

Released: TBD

## Overview

TBD

## Added

- **Unified Story Builder** (`/story-builder`): a new guided page that walks a story from idea → universe aesthetic → plot arc → reader map → characters → issues → production as one linear flow. Each step is LLM-assisted with an AI-refinement affordance and ends with an explicit lock before the next unlocks; going back to revise an earlier step soft-flags the downstream locked steps as "stale" (integrity gate) so nothing silently drifts — without destroying their content. The builder is a thin conductor over the existing Universe / Series / Issue records (no data duplication); heavy per-issue production hands off to the existing Pipeline issue page. Reachable from the sidebar (Create → Story Builder), ⌘K, and voice. The intro screen supports two intake modes: **start from a seed idea**, or **import a finished work** (comic script / screenplay / novel / short story) — the importer reverse-engineers it into a universe, arc, characters, and issues, then drops you into the wizard to review and lock each stage. An **AI provider/model picker** at the top of the builder (and the import tab) drives every operation — idea expand, aesthetic, arc, reader map, character refine, and the import analysis — persisted on the session so one selection applies throughout. The **characters step generates a styled preview image per character** (world style fused with the character descriptor, via the same render path as the Universe Builder) and shows it alongside each character so you can eyeball that the world and character styles read correctly together.
- **Base style image (style probe)** on a universe: generate a canonical image from the raw style guide alone — style notes + the embrace/avoid influences as the positive/negative prompt, with no character or subject — to preview the world's base visual emphasis. Triggerable from both the Universe Builder (under the style/influences editor) and the Story Builder's Universe Aesthetic step; the result persists on the universe (`styleImageRefs`) so both surfaces share it.
- **Reader Map** on a series arc (`series.arc.readerMap`): a distinct audience-experience roadmap — hooks, payoffs, emotional beats, and cliffhangers across the arc — built on top of the Vonnegut story shape, separate from the protagonist arc. Generated and refined via the new Story Builder reader-map step (also preserved by arc regeneration).

## Changed

## Fixed

- **Story Builder data-loss fixes** surfaced by the local-review pass on the unified-story-builder branch:
  - `generateStep('plotArc')` was wholesale-replacing `series.arc` and `series.seasons` via a plain `updateSeries({ arc, seasons })`, which silently dropped per-field arc locks, locked seasons, and orphaned every child issue attached to a renamed/removed season. Route through `commitSeasonsWithRemap` (same helper the Arc Canvas regenerator uses) so locks are honored and orphaned issues are remapped via normalized title → number → positional fallback.
  - `resolveVerifyIssues` (the auto-resolve path off the Arc Canvas verify panel) was silently wiping `series.arc.readerMap`: the LLM payload doesn't author the reader map, so omitting it from the sanitizeArc call defaulted the field to `null` and `commitSeasonsWithRemap`'s `mergeArcWithLocks` only restores fields when their per-field lock is `true`. A user who'd generated a reader map without locking it lost the entire map the first time they auto-resolved a finding. The sibling `generateArcOverview` already had this fix; `resolveVerifyIssues` drifted from it despite the "Mirrors `resolveVerifyIssues`" comment.
  - Reader-map prompt JSON example used a pipe-separated enum string for `kind` (`"hook|reveal|payoff|emotional|cliffhanger"`), which LLMs reproduced literally; `sanitizeReaderBeat` then dropped every beat because the joined string isn't in `READER_MAP_BEAT_KINDS`, leaving `beats: []` and tripping the empty-payload check. Replaced with a single valid example (`"hook"`); the earlier `{{beatKindsCsv}}` line still enumerates the controlled vocabulary.
  - Story Builder `currentStep` PATCH schema was `z.string().max(40)` and the sanitizer silently coerced unknown values to `STEP_IDS[0]` — a stale client that posted a removed step id would land on the first step with no error. Now `z.enum(STEP_IDS)`; the sanitizer's coerce-on-load fallback stays for resilience against pre-existing corrupted files.
  - `styleImageRefs` route caps (`.max(50)` on POST and PATCH) were 4× the sanitizer cap (`IMAGE_REFS_PER_ENTRY_MAX` = 12), so a 40-entry POST silently 200'd with 28 entries dropped. Aligned to the shared `entryImageRefsField` so over-the-cap requests get a loud 400.
  - Boot-time `verifyCollectionVersions` array didn't include the Story Builder store; type-level schema drift would have gone unnoticed.
  - "Lock the earlier steps first" toast misfired when the step was blocked by upstream-staleness (every earlier step IS locked, but one is stale). Discriminated `reachable()` → `'unlocked' | 'stale' | true` so the toast says "Re-review the stale earlier step first" in that case.

  Dev machines that already ran migration 043 with the buggy reader-map prompts keep the bad copies in `data/prompts/stages/` — delete `story-builder-reader-map.md` and `story-builder-reader-map-refine.md` from that directory, then restart, and migration 043 will re-copy the fixed versions from `data.reference/`. Fresh installs are unaffected.

- Series detail page: when the Story Bible drawer is open, the Series Arc + Editorial Roadmap split and the inner text + 260px Themes panel split now respond to the actual content-area width instead of viewport width. Switched to Tailwind v4 container queries — Roadmap drops below Arc when the content area is < 1024px, and Themes stacks below the logline/summary column when the Arc card is < 672px, preventing the text column from being squeezed into an unreadable strip.
