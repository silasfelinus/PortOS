# Unreleased Changes

## Added

- **Animated 3D mini-character CoS avatars (bundled, CC0)** — two new Chief-of-Staff avatar styles, **Mini Character — Male (3D)** and **Mini Character — Female (3D)**, ship as rigged, animated GLB models out of the box (no user setup, no download). Unlike the `muse` style (which needs you to drop your own `data/avatar/model.glb`), these render immediately and play real skeletal animations mapped to the CoS agent state — `idle` while thinking, `walk` while coding, `sit` while sleeping, `sprint` while ideating, `emote-yes` while reviewing — plus a slow turntable rotation and a speaking head-bob, with clips crossfading on state change. The models are Kenney's [Mini Characters](https://kenney.nl/assets/mini-characters) (Creative Commons Zero), re-exported with the texture embedded and Draco compression disabled so they render offline / over Tailscale without fetching an external decoder from a CDN. Each is ~210 KB and ships in `data.reference/avatar/` (seeded into `data/avatar/` by `npm run setup:data`). The avatar route gained a safe `?variant=<name>` selector (strict `[a-z0-9-]` validation, no path traversal) so multiple bundled characters share one endpoint. Drop any rigged GLB at `data/avatar/<name>.glb` to add your own.

- **[issue-1092] Vocal takes remember their pitch analysis** — when you record a take against a song's notated melody, the take now keeps its color-match grading (percent-in-tune and per-note accuracy) and the tuner trace. Each saved take shows its score in the takes list, and a Review button replays that grading on the staff without re-singing.

- **Public API surface with per-API auth gating (Voice/TTS + sdapi):** PortOS can now serve individual services as HTTP APIs on your tailnet. A new **Settings → API Access** tab exposes per-API toggles — *Expose on the network* (off by default) and *Require auth* (off = passwordless) — so you can keep the whole app behind your PortOS password while leaving the **Voice/TTS** and **Image Gen (sdapi)** APIs open for other machines to call. A deliberately-minimal `POST /api/voice/public/synthesize` (plus `/voices` and `/engines`) turns text into WAV audio with any engine/voice/rate; config and process-control endpoints always stay gated. A single in-tree registry (`server/lib/apiRegistry.js`) drives the auth-gate exemptions, the settings UI, and a native **OpenAPI 3.1 spec** at `GET /api/api-docs/openapi.json` (no swagger dependency — request bodies are generated from the same Zod schemas the routes validate against). The API Access tab shows each API's public base URL and a copy-paste `curl` example, and the Voice settings tab links to it. Defaults are safe: both APIs ship not-exposed and passwordless-once-exposed, with a migration seeding the key for existing installs.

## Fixed

- **[issue-1080] Notes synced from other machines become searchable promptly** — a Brain note, daily-log entry, person, project, or idea created or edited on one of your machines is now re-indexed into semantic memory on the others as soon as it syncs, instead of waiting for a full manual re-sync. Edits and deletes that arrive from a peer also refresh or retire the matching memory entry, so search no longer surfaces stale copies of records that changed elsewhere. A new **Refresh embeddings** button on the Brain graph re-indexes everything in one pass to heal anything that drifted before this fix.

## Changed

- **[issue-1094] Federation "Make mutual" sync behavior clarified** — documented and locked in how toggling a sync category toward a peer stays mirrored on both machines. No change to how syncing behaves.

- **[issue-1114] Hardened backup-settings test coverage** — added tests pinning the "Run Backup Now" button's saved-state gating and the already-running skip path, so a regression can't silently break them.

- **[issue-1104] CyberCity mini-map now shows the waterfront** — the HUD mini-map draws the bay and a Data Harbor marker, so the top-down map matches the city's real geography instead of plotting only the buildings.
