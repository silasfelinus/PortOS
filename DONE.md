### 2026-05-17

- **[extract-upsertbyidprepend-helper-universe-builder] Extract `upsertByIdPrepend(list, item)` helper.** New `client/src/lib/upsertByIdPrepend.js` collapses the "filter-by-id then prepend" worlds-list upsert into one helper. The PLAN line called out 3 sites; the actual count was 7 — all collapsed to `setWorlds((prev) => upsertByIdPrepend(prev, entity))`: 1 in `client/src/hooks/useUniverseAction.js` (LLM-action result merge) + 6 in `client/src/pages/UniverseBuilder.jsx` (`handleCreate`, `handleSave`, expand auto-save, refine auto-save, `handleMoveCategoryToTrunk`, `handleGenerateInCategory`). 4 new vitest cases in `upsertByIdPrepend.test.js` (new-id prepend, id replacement, empty-list, no input mutation).
- **[universe-builder-redesign-trunks-sub-buckets] Universe Builder redesign — trunks + sub-buckets layout (Phases A–D + Phase C follow-ups).** Multi-phase rewrite landing across 2026-05-15 → 2026-05-17. Phase A added a `kind: 'characters'|'settings'|'objects'|'other'` field to every category bucket + a migration to backfill the built-in defaults; Phase B taught `buildExpansionPrompt()` + `isExpansionShape()` to emit and accept rich canon arrays alongside categories, with client-side `handleExpand` merging canon entries into `universe.{characters,settings,objects}` (dedupe by name, respect locks); Phase C rewrote the page as a tabbed-trunk layout (Bible / Cast / Places / Objects / Other / Composites / Render) with URL state, a unified `EntryCard` rendering both canon entries and category variations, and per-trunk / per-bucket / all-canon batch-render targeting; Phase D shipped `POST /:id/promote-variation` to LLM-expand a variation into a full canon entry (atomic canon append + variation removal in one `updateUniverse` patch, duplicate-name 409 before the LLM call, trunk picker for `kind: 'other'` buckets). Phase C follow-ups closed today: (1) `updateUniverse(id, mutator)` now accepts an async `mutator(latest) => patch` callback that runs INSIDE `queueUniverseWrite` — `autoSortOtherBuckets` and `promoteVariationToCanon` route their read-modify-write through this so a slow LLM call can't admit a concurrent edit between read and persist; promote's variation removal also re-locates by label inside the queue rather than relying on the stale pre-LLM index, and the duplicate-name 409 is re-checked against the latest canon (returns `UNIVERSE_PROMOTE_CATEGORY_GONE` / `UNIVERSE_PROMOTE_VARIATION_GONE` when the bucket/variation disappears mid-flight); (2) `handleAutoSort` / `handlePromoteVariation` / `handleGenerateInCategory` now flush a dirty draft via `handleSave()` before kicking off — `UniverseBuilder.jsx` tracks a `savedDraftSnapshotRef` baseline (compared via `draftSnapshotForDirty`) that updates on universe-load, manual save, expand auto-save, refine auto-save, generate auto-save, and after each LLM mutator's `onFreshResult` merge. `useUniverseAction` gained a `preflight` option that runs AFTER the ref/savedId guard so double-clicks short-circuit before flushing. 5 new server tests (`updateUniverse` mutator overload — happy path, null-skip, throw-propagation, non-object validation, queue-ordering against a parallel literal-patch write) + 4 new client tests (`useUniverseAction` preflight — returns-false abort, throw-as-false, returns-true continue, post-ref-guard ordering).
- **[extract-useuniverseaction-hook] Extract `useUniverseAction` hook from `UniverseBuilder.jsx`.** New `client/src/hooks/useUniverseAction.js` consolidates the scaffolding shared by `handlePromoteVariation` + `handleAutoSort`: `selectedId` guard, per-action ref re-entrancy, `capturedId` snapshot, loading-toast lifecycle (`silent: true` + `.catch` → dismiss + error), mountedRef-gated busy reset, always-update `setWorlds`, and the `mountedRef.current && capturedId === selectedId` stale-write guard. Each caller now passes only what varies — its `ref`/`setBusy`/`loadingMessage`/`errorPrefix`/`notSavedMessage`, the API call (receives `capturedId`), and an `onFreshResult(result)` callback that does the selective `setDraft` and returns the success-toast string. `handleGenerateInCategory` is intentionally NOT a consumer (the PLAN line's "to a lesser extent" — eager local merge first + best-effort save is a different shape; forcing it through would warp it); the hook header documents this. 9 new vitest cases in `useUniverseAction.test.jsx` (selectedId guard, re-entrancy, happy path, stale-write, action-rejects, no-loading-toast variant, falsy-universe result, suppressed-toast onFreshResult, unmount mid-flight). PLAN.md description gated this on "extract when a 4th handler lands"; promoted now with 3 — the hook itself is small and the scaffold is the most-bug-prone piece of these handlers.
- **[extract-builduniversestylecontext-helper] Extract `buildUniverseStyleContext(universe, options)` helper.** New helper in `server/services/universeBuilder.js` (next to `joinInfluenceList`) renders the shared "Universe context" prompt block (LOGLINE / optional PREMISE / STYLE NOTES / optional EMBRACE INFLUENCES). Three call sites collapsed: `buildAutoSortPrompt` (`universeBuilderAutoSort.js`, `escape: true`), `buildPromotePrompt` (`universeBuilderPromote.js`, default opts + headerSuffix), and `buildCategoryGeneratePrompt` (`universeBuilderExpand.js`, `includePremise: true` + `includeEmbrace: false` since it has its own influences section). Toggles cover the actual variance: `includePremise`, `includeEmbrace`, `escape` (newline/control-char stripping for defense-in-depth), `headerSuffix` (per-call header framing). 9 new unit tests in `universeBuilder.test.js` assert byte-exact outputs for each call shape. Pipeline call sites at `visualStages.js` and `seriesTitleLogo.js` were inspected but are out of scope — they only use `joinInfluenceList` for render-style composition and template variables, not the LOGLINE/STYLE NOTES/EMBRACE block. `buildExpansionPrompt`'s "Current universe state" block also stays separate — its `[LOCKED]` flags + `LOCKABLE_FIELD_LABELS` make it too distinct to fold without compromising the helper.
- **[extract-descriptorforcanonentry-kind-entry-into] Extract `descriptorForCanonEntry(kind, entry)` into `server/lib/canonPrompt.js` (mirror in client).** New `server/lib/canonPrompt.js` + `client/src/lib/canonPrompt.js` mirror is the single source of truth for per-kind canon descriptor fields. Exports `shortCanonDescriptorFragments` (UI summary scope: physicalDescription || description for chars; description + Palette + recurringDetails for settings; description || significance for objects), `richCanonDescriptorFragments` (adds role, era, weather, significance-as-additive — the render-prompt scope), `descriptorForCanonEntry` (flattened short string matching legacy `KINDS[].descFor`), and `hasCanonDescriptorContent` (rich-field union for "is there anything to render?" gates). Migrated four call sites: `synthesizeCanonPrompt` (`server/services/universeBuilder.js`), `KINDS[].descFor` (`client/src/components/universe/UniverseCanonSection.jsx`), `canonEntryHasContent` (`client/src/pages/UniverseBuilder.jsx`), and `settingFrags` in `server/lib/scenePrompt.js` + client mirror. Tests: 29 new in `server/lib/canonPrompt.test.js`. Minor cosmetic uniformity in canon render prompts: lowercase `palette:`/`era:`/`weather:`/`significance:` prefixes are now capitalized (`Palette:` etc.) to match the UI descriptor format — case-only diff, no functional impact on diffusion models.
- **[auto-sort-with-ai-llm-classify-each-kind-other] Universe Builder — Auto-sort with AI.** New `POST /api/universe-builder/:id/auto-sort` (server: `server/services/universeBuilderAutoSort.js`, `server/routes/universeBuilder.js`) batches every `kind: 'other'` bucket into a single LLM call that returns `{ classifications: [{ key, kind, suggestedKey? }] }`. The service applies kind reassignments atomically via one `updateUniverse` patch (defensive per-entry kind gate filters hallucinated kinds); `suggestedKey` renames stay opt-in — they surface as a count in the success toast but the bucket key isn't auto-renamed. Replaces the Other-tab's toast-stub `onAutoSort` handler with a real spinner-driven handler in `client/src/pages/UniverseBuilder.jsx`; new `autoSortBuckets` API helper in `client/src/services/apiUniverseBuilder.js`. Concurrent-edit safety: the service re-fetches the latest universe state immediately before the write so a variation added to a soon-to-be-classified bucket in another tab during the LLM call isn't overwritten; the client merges only the reclassified buckets into the draft to preserve user edits to other buckets. Covered by 16 unit tests in `universeBuilderAutoSort.test.js` (happy path, no-other-buckets short-circuit, hallucinated-key filter, `LLM_INVALID_JSON` (empty response + no-parse + non-array `classifications`) vs `NO_CLASSIFICATIONS` paths, `NO_PROVIDER` gate, prompt-injection defense — ASCII newlines pinned on labels + styleNotes + logline; Unicode LS/PS/NEL + form feed + vertical tab pinned on labels, logline, and styleNotes) + 4 route tests in `universeBuilder.test.js` + 2 client tests in `UniverseBuilder.test.jsx` for `OtherTab` (Auto-sort button fires `onAutoSort` when enabled; disabled with "Sorting…" label while `autoSorting=true`).
- **[extract-a-shared-tabpills-primitive-in-client-src] Extract a shared `<TabPills>` primitive in `client/src/components/ui/`.** New `client/src/components/ui/TabPills.jsx` with two variants (`underline` default + `pills` for UniverseBuilder) and knobs for the call-site quirks: `runningKind` (StoryboardPanel's per-tab spinner), `stretch` (flex-1 equal-width tabs), `mobileDropdown` (UniverseBuilder's `<select>` fallback), `hideLabelOnMobile` (Brain/DigitalTwin/ChiefOfStaff icon-only at < sm), `controlsIdPrefix` (ChiefOfStaff's `aria-controls` wiring), `listRef`+`onScroll` (ChiefOfStaff's scroll-arrow overlay). Migrated ten call sites — two local `TabNav` components (UniverseBuilder, StoryboardPanel) plus eight inline tab-button blocks (Brain, Calendar, ChiefOfStaff, DigitalTwin, MediaGen, Messages, Settings, Wiki). Net -250+ LOC consolidated into one primitive + 7 vitest cases. Small intentional visual unification across the surface area: StoryboardPanel active text-white → text-port-accent, ChiefOfStaff/Settings gained the standard `bg-port-accent/5` active wash + `hover:bg-port-card` inactive. PipelineIssue's status-dot tab variant is captured in PLAN.md as a follow-up needing a `trailing` slot extension on the primitive.
- **[unify-canoncard-variation-card-into-a-single] Universe Builder — unify CanonCard + variation card into shared `EntryCard` shell.** New `client/src/components/universe/EntryCard.jsx` slot-based primitive (locked accent, title row, body, action column, optional thumbnail, optional footer). `CanonCard` now renders through it and surfaces a top-left thumbnail derived from `primaryImageRef` (falling back to the first `imageRefs[0]`) so each canon entry has a visual at-a-glance. The variation `<li>` in `CategoryEditor` is extracted into a `VariationCard` helper that also renders through `EntryCard` — view mode shows label + prompt + action column (promote / render / lock / edit / remove); edit mode swaps the body for an inline form. Visual consistency between the two card families now flows from the shared shell rather than parallel Tailwind class strings.
- **[client-component-tests-for-categoryeditor-promote] Client component tests for `CategoryEditor` + `TrunkView`.** Wired up the first vitest-based client test suite (vitest 3 + jsdom + @testing-library/react + user-event) — new `client/vitest.config.js`, `client/src/test/setup.js`, `test` + `test:watch` scripts in `client/package.json`, CI step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Named-exported `CategoryEditor` and `TrunkView` from `client/src/pages/UniverseBuilder.jsx` and added `client/src/pages/UniverseBuilder.test.jsx` covering: promote button disabled when `!canPromote` (parent's `!selectedId`); promote fires directly with no targetKind for a kinded bucket; clicking promote on a `bucketKind: null` ("other") variation opens the trunk picker; clicking a picker option calls `onPromote(variation, { targetKind })` with the correct kind; `TrunkView` "Bulk-render all" button disabled at zero count and enabled with the right count from variations. Three pre-existing orphaned client tests (`cleanPlatePrompt`, `clipboard`, `normalize`) now run too.

- **CoS — explicit `init()` instead of module-level auto-init.** Dropped the `NODE_ENV !== 'test' && VITEST !== 'true'` guard from `server/services/cos.js`; `init` is now exported and called from `server/index.js` alongside the other startup `*.init()` calls. Test imports no longer spin up event listeners / timers as a side effect, and the prod boot path no longer branches on test-env vars.
- **Universe Builder DRY — `resolveProviderAndModel` + `findBibleEntryByName`.** Two shared helpers landed in `server/lib/`. The first collapses four inlined `getProviderById/getActiveProvider/resolveEffectiveModel` chains across the universe-builder LLM entrypoints onto one helper; the second consolidates the "case-insensitive name OR alias" predicate at the promote duplicate-collision check. (The retired-characters bucket fold keeps its O(1) seen-set index since it folds entries into a growing array — a per-iteration linear scan would have made it O(n*m).)
- **CoS / Agent lifecycle hardening.** Six backlog items flushed in one pass. (1) TUI providers now usable from the manual `/api/runs` runner panel — the client-side disable was stale once the server-side `executeTuiRun` branch landed in `routes/runs.js`. (2) Extracted two complementary helpers in `agentLifecycle.js` so the central completion sequence is shared between runner-mode `handleAgentCompletion`, the TUI `finish` path, and the direct-CLI `close` handler: `releaseAgentLane({ agentId, success, duration, exitCode, executionId, laneName, errorExecutionMessage })` fires lane release + tool-execution tracking EARLY (before output I/O / error analysis / state writes) so other lane tasks aren't blocked, and `finalizeAgent({ agentId, task, runId, providerId, success, exitCode, duration, outputBuffer, errorAnalysis, terminatedByUser, isTruthyMetaFn, error, completionReason })` runs the centralized state writes sequentially (persistSimplifySummaries → completeAgent → completeAgentRun → updateTask → provider markers → processAgentCompletion). A future divergence in any leg is now a one-place fix. (3) Wrapped `handleAgentCompletion` in try/finally so a throw from any inner step still drops the `runnerAgents` Map entry (previously leaked forever on memory-extraction crashes, JIRA push failures, etc.). (4) Added `isTuiProvider` next to `isClaudeCliProvider` and lifted `providerTypeClass` from `AIProviders.jsx` into `client/src/utils/providers.js`. (5) Converted `spawnTuiAgent` + `spawnDirectly` from 11-positional-arg signatures to options objects. (6) Wrapped `shellService.createShellSession` for agent TUIs in a thin `createAgentTuiSession({ agentId, provider, tuiConfig, cwd, onData, onExit })` helper. Regression-pin tests in `agentLifecycle.test.js` flipped from "documents the gap" to "asserts the guard fires."
- **Importer — section follow-ups landed.** Auto-detect content type stage (`importer-classify`, light-tier head pass that pre-selects the radio); in-place `proseExcerpt` edit affordance per issue card so users can trim/correct boundaries without re-running Analyze (3 heavy-tier calls); `replaceMode` flag wipes existing issues + overwrites arc/seasons on re-import (destructive opt-in for existing series); partial-commit retry now drops arc/seasons/canon from the retry payload via `arcAlreadyPersisted` context so a parallel-tab edit isn't overwritten; React.memo on per-issue and per-season cards (with stable patcher + memoized seasonOptions) so unedited cards skip render on keystroke; `ARC_SHAPE_IDS` exposed via `/importer/config` and `IMPORTER_ARC_ROLES_FALLBACK` retired from the client (server is now the sole source of arc roles + shape ids); screenplay-prompt split logic gates on `isUserRequestedCount` rather than conflating it with the per-type default; "(first season)" UI label replaced with the actual lowest-numbered season + title.
- **Sharing — auto-unsubscribe on local record delete.** `recordEvents.js` now hooks `deleteSeries` / `deleteUniverse` so orphaned `data/sharing/subscriptions.json` entries clean up automatically instead of logging errors on the next re-export attempt.
- **Pipeline — `spawningTasks` lifecycle.** Widened try/finally around `spawnAgentForTask` (`server/services/agentLifecycle.js`) so a throw in any async setup step releases the per-task spawn lock instead of stranding it forever.
- **Pipeline — `creativeDirectorPrompts.test.js` imageStrength assertions.** Test now matches the updated prompt template wording; full suite passes.
- **Importer — Create Suite reverse-engineering page.** `/importer` analyzes a finished story / novel / screenplay / comic script and produces universe canon + series arc + prose-seeded issues; three new stage prompts with Mustache content-type branching; case-insensitive find-or-create; locked-arc gating.
- **Universe-as-Canon Phase B.4 schema teardown.** Removed `series.{characters,settings,objects}` from sanitizer + Zod schemas; deleted `extractAndMergeIntoSeries` / `refineCharacterDescription` / `nounRefine.js` / `purgeImageRefFromAllSeries`; routes `POST /pipeline/series/:id/extract-bible` + `/characters/:entryId/refine` removed; `seriesCanon.js` simplified to universe-or-empty.
- **Universe Canon UX follow-ups.** Per-series filter dropdown on Universe Canon page (`?series=<id>` URL param); "Appears in" list sorted by `issueCount`; per-series `stylePromptOverride` wired through `applyWorldStyle` + NounsStage previews.
- **Sharing v1.4 — collection-aware universe shares.** `mediaCollections.universeId` links a collection to its parent universe; exporter bundles the collection + items + assets + media-job records; importer find-or-creates the local collection and unions items; item add/remove emits `recordEvents` on the linked universe so subscriptions auto-re-export.
- **Sharing — route-level tests for `server/routes/sharing.js`.** New `server/routes/sharing.test.js` covers bucket CRUD, export (kinds + missing-payload refinement), inbox actions, subscriptions, activity, and error mapping (28 tests). Locks the HTTP/JSON contract (Zod rejection + 201 vs 200 + service-error code passthrough) that integration.test.js + subscriptions.test.js previously bypassed by exercising the service layer directly.
- **Sharing — manifest archive pruning.** Long-lived sharing buckets no longer accumulate thousands of one-shot manifest JSONs; owned manifests over the cap are archived (peer/subscription manifests exempt).
- **Sharing — display-name & bio settings tab.** Source-attribution fields now also editable under `/settings/sharing`.
- **Pipeline — Story Arc Planning.** PipelineSeries rebuilt into an Arc → Season → Episode tree with three LLM passes (arc overview, per-season episodes, cross-season verify) and a two-pane bible-sidebar + card-canvas layout.
- **Writers Room ↔ Pipeline unification.** Shared story-bible schema (Character/Setting/Object), staged-LLM runner, scene-prompt composer, bible-extraction service, prompt-template partials, "Promote work to Pipeline" bridge, and Storyboards auto-fill from prose or TV script.
- **Creative Director — episode video end-to-end.** Pipeline `episodeVideo` stage wires storyboards → CD treatment → render → final stitched MP4 inline; slim API endpoint, ScenePreview component, multi-frame evaluator sampling, auto-accept ffprobe watchdog, cheaper smoke-test fixture, per-scene `imageStrength` for i2v continuity.
- **CoS — Workflow tab.** Left-to-right pipeline view of all scheduled tasks + autonomous jobs grouped into seven canonical stages with `runAfter` dependency arrows.
- **CoS — review-loop auto-merge.** Tasks with `openPR + reviewLoop` now spawn a follow-up agent that polls Copilot, pushes fixes until clean, and `gh pr merge --squash --auto`.
- **CoS — dismissible AI recommendations.** Per-card X dismisses Learning Analytics suggestions; count-based alerts only re-surface on significant growth.
- **World Builder for Media Gen.** One-line starter prompt expands via LLM into a structured prompt set (style prefix, negative, 6–10 variations across five buckets) and batch-renders into an auto-named Media Collection.
- **Civitai / Z-Image follow-ups (six cleanups).** `RUNNER_FAMILIES` constants module, shared `deepMerge` / `assertSafeFilename` utilities, drift-warning for `mediaModels.js`, and CLI `--model` flag now honored across claude-code + gemini-cli + codex.
- **Shared `<Modal>` component.** Nine modal call sites converged onto one accessible Modal with backdrop + Esc + portal + ARIA.
- **Shared LLM / JSON / Python runner helpers.** Unified four near-identical "call provider, accumulate text, reject on error" implementations into `promptRunner.js`; consolidated three CLI-banner JSON extractors into `jsonExtract.js`; extracted ~200 LOC of duplicated device/HF-error handling from flux2 + z-image Python runners into `_runner_common.py`.
- **Video Gen — LTX-2.3 capabilities.** Native audio-to-video (a2v) on dgrauet (WAV/MP3 + optional first-frame conditioning); native Extend pipeline replacing the legacy chained-i2v fallback; FFLF keyframe-pair guidance hint; deprecated notapalindrome models grouped under "Legacy".
- **Pipeline — auto-run resumption.** On boot, stuck `running` issues demote to `needs-review` so a crash mid-run doesn't strand the pipeline.

## 2026-04

- **Global Command Palette (⌘K).** Single nav manifest (`navManifest.js`) shared by palette + voice agent's `ui_navigate`; any new page registered there is instantly keyboard- and voice-reachable.
- **Customizable Dashboard with Saved Layouts.** 15-widget registry + named layouts (`default` / `focus` / `morning-review` / `ops`) with drag/resize Arrange mode; `⌘K` switches layouts by name.
- **Ask Yourself.** Conversational `/ask` mode with parallel retrieval across memory + brain notes + autobiography + goals + calendar; voice `ui_ask` entry point with intent-classifier gating; per-turn promotions ("Save as Brain note" / "Create CoS task" / "Attach to Goal…").
- **God-file decomposition.** `routes/cos.js`, `routes/scaffold.js`, `client/api.js`, `services/digital-twin.js`, and `subAgentSpawner.js` split into focused modules.
- **Better-Audit remediation.** Security overrides for transitive deps (path-to-regexp, lodash, basic-ftp, etc.), centralized helpers (`pgQuoteIdentifier`, `escapeJql`, `atomicWrite`), graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown, fetch-timeouts via `AbortSignal.timeout` across remaining sites, and significant CoS-route test coverage expansion (83–100%).

## 2026-03

- **Depfree audit (heavy mode).** Removed 13 third-party packages (`uuid`, `cors`, `axios`, `multer`, `unzipper`, `node-telegram-bot-api`, `supertest`, `geist`, `globals`, `fflate`, `react-markdown`, `react-diff-viewer-continued`, `react-hot-toast`) by writing ~1,100 lines of owned in-tree replacements.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help Modal.** Press `?` for a global accessible overlay listing all shortcuts grouped by section.
- **Code-hardening pass.** `response.ok` checks across PromptManager fetches, type-safe sort comparators, replaced silent catches with logging, optional-chaining on DB row access, centralized 15 path constants in `PATHS`, migrated 36 files to centralized paths, replaced 57 `mkdir({recursive:true})` with `ensureDir()`.
