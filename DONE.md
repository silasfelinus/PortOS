## 2026-05-09

- **Creative Director — i2v continuity fidelity (per-scene `imageStrength`)** — Added `imageStrength` (0..1, nullable) to `creativeDirectorSceneSchema` + `creativeDirectorSceneUpdateSchema`; `sceneRunner.resolveImageStrength` defaults continuation scenes (`useContinuationFromPrior=true`) to 0.85 and lets the evaluator override on retry. Already threaded through `videoGen/local.js#generateVideo` → mediaJobQueue. `creativeDirectorPrompts.js` surfaces the current setting on the evaluate view; `cd-treatment.md` / `cd-evaluate.md` document the knob; `TreatmentTab.jsx` shows "str X" on the scene chip. (PR #208)
- **CoS Workflow tab + canonical scheduled-task ordering** — New `/cos/workflow` page renders the full set of scheduled tasks + autonomous jobs as a left-to-right pipeline grouped into 7 canonical stages (Hygiene → Review → Plan → Audit → Build → Report → Ambient). Each card surfaces schedule, last-run, run count, enabled state, and live "due / waiting / disabled / waiting-on-dependencies" badge plus inline `runAfter` arrows. Backed by `server/services/workflow.js` + `routes/cosWorkflowRoutes.js` (`GET /api/cos/workflow`, `GET /api/cos/workflow/stages`). Two default `runAfter` wirings ship: `do-replan` runs after `pr-reviewer` + `branch-cleanup`, `feature-ideas` runs after `do-replan`. 16 new unit tests + 3 schedule tests. (PR #212)
- **World Builder for Media Gen** — `/media/world-builder` takes a one-line starter prompt (e.g. "moebius and scavengers reign meets Prophet inspired sci-fi universe") and asks the chosen LLM to expand it into a structured prompt set: positive `stylePrompt` prefix, `negativePrompt`, and 6–10 variations across five canonical buckets (landscapes, environments, characters, structures, vehicles). Per-template provider/model picker, batch-render compiles `stylePrompt + variation.prompt` for every selected bucket and queues through the existing image-gen pipeline (local mflux or Codex). Each batch lands in an auto-named Media Collection ("World: <name> — <timestamp>"). Backed by `server/services/worldBuilder.js`, `worldBuilderExpand.js`, `worldBuilderCollectionHook.js`, `routes/worldBuilder.js`. State in `data/world-builder.json`. 20 new tests. Nav manifest entry `nav.media.world-builder`. (PR #211)
- **Dismissible CoS Learning AI Recommendations** — Each recommendation in the Learning Analytics panel has an X to dismiss. Persists to `data/cos/dismissed-recommendations.json` and filters from future loads. Count-based alerts ("unknown errors occurred 74 times") record the count snapshot and only re-surface if the count grows ≥1.5× and at least +20. Rate-based recommendations stay dismissed until restored. "Show dismissed" expander lets you restore individually or clear all.
- **CoS review-loop tasks loop until clean and merge the PR** — Scheduled or user tasks running with worktree + openPR + reviewLoop now spawn a follow-up internal task once the PR is open and the initial Copilot review is requested. The follow-up agent attaches a fresh worktree to the PR branch (new `existingBranch` option on `createWorktree`), runs the full `/do:rpr`-style poll/fix/push/re-request loop until Copilot returns zero unresolved comments (or hits a 10-iteration guardrail), then `gh pr merge --squash --auto --delete-branch`. The follow-up's cleanup pass passes `skipMerge: true` so the worktree branch isn't re-merged on top of the squash-merge. GitLab MRs and other non-GitHub forges still skip the loop. (`server/services/agentLifecycle.js#spawnReviewLoopFollowUp`, `agentPromptBuilder.js#reviewLoopFollowUpSection`)
- **CyberCity v2 — Phase 1 operational legibility** — Per-building health glyphs, "needs attention" pane, search overlay, status filter chips (`CityFilterBar.jsx`), clickable HUD stats, hover preview with quick actions, mobile/touch support. Phase 2 (interactive systems map / drill-down + agent-paths) still pending — see [docs/features/cybercity-v2.md](./docs/features/cybercity-v2.md).
- **Better Audit follow-up — socket.js disconnect cleanup** — `socket.on('disconnect')` calls `shellService.detachSocketSessions(socket)` which transitively calls `unsubscribeSessionList(socket)` (`server/services/shell.js:217`). The cleanup the audit flagged as missing is wired correctly via the higher-level helper.

## 2026-05-06

- **Creative Director — multi-frame evaluator sampling** — `extractEvaluationFrames` in `server/lib/ffmpeg.js` probes total frames and writes 5 timeline-tagged samples; `sceneRunner.handleRenderCompleted` calls it before evaluator enqueue; `buildEvaluatePrompt` lists every frame with explicit late-intent guidance. Falls back to single thumbnail on extraction failure.
- **Creative Director — auto-accept watchdog** — `verifyVideoPlayable()` in `server/lib/ffmpeg.js` checks file-exists / size > 0 / ffprobe-can-read-at-least-1-frame before marking auto-accept; failures route through `handleRenderFailed` honoring `MAX_SCENE_RETRIES`.
- **Creative Director — smoke-test cost reduction** — `durationSeconds` 3s→2s + hidden `1:1-small` (384×384) aspect preset for the smoke fixture; ~63% pixel-frame cost reduction.
- **LTX-2.3 audio-to-video (a2v)** — `run_a2v` invokes `AudioToVideoPipeline.generate_and_save` with `--audio` (WAV/MP3) and optional first-frame conditioning. Multipart `uploadFields(['sourceImage','lastImage','audioFile'])`, `mode='a2v'` enum, fail-fast guards (`VIDEO_GEN_AUDIO_REQUIRED`, `VIDEO_GEN_AUDIO_MODE_MISMATCH`, `A2V_REQUIRES_LTX2`), client tile + audio picker, queue-boundary `audioFilePath` sanitization.
- **LTX-2.3 native video Extend on dgrauet** — `helperMode='extend'` + `extendFromVideoPath` threading in `videoGen/local.js`, `extendFromVideoId` in `routes/videoGen.js`, client routes Extend to native dgrauet path when model runtime='ltx2'. Legacy chained-i2v retained for `mlx_video` runtime. Tests cover route id resolution.

## 2026-04-28

- **Better Audit follow-up — bugs/perf/test quality** — Added `AbortSignal.timeout` to remaining fetch sites (`aiDetect.js`, `meatspacePostLlm.js`, `memoryEmbeddings.js` ×3, `telegramBridge.js`); fixed `httpClient.js` abort-listener leak via cleanup + `{ once: true }`; fixed `MessageDetail.jsx` iframe `load` listener leak via `{ once: true }`; parallelized `feeds.js` refresh with `Promise.allSettled` over `fetchAndParseFeed`; replaced vacuous `usage.test.js` typeof checks with real streak-calculation assertions; `cosRunnerClient.test.js` now uses `.rejects.toThrow` for capacity/spawn/kill/terminate paths; `subAgentSpawner.test.js` imports the real `selectModelForTask` instead of re-implementing it; added `loops.test.js`.
- **Ask Yourself — slice (b)** — Voice (`ui_ask`) + per-turn promotions ("Save as Brain note" / "Create CoS task" / "Attach to Goal…") with auto-pin to survive 30-day expiry; palette whitelist for `⌘K` → `Ask Yourself`; ask-intent classifier gates the voice tool to RAG-shaped phrasing only; barge-in cancels upstream `askService` stream via `AbortSignal`. 17 new tests; suite 2785/2785 green.

## 2026-04-24

- **Global Command Palette (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`)** — `client/src/components/CmdKSearch.jsx` + `server/lib/navManifest.js` (single source of truth) + `server/routes/palette.js` (manifest + action dispatch). Shared backbone with voice agent's `ui_navigate` so navigation, palette, and voice all resolve through one map. See CLAUDE.md "Command Palette & Voice Nav" for the entry shape every new page must register.
- **Customizable Dashboard with Saved Layouts** — Widget registry (`client/src/components/dashboard/widgetRegistry.jsx`, 15 widgets, 3 data-gated) + named layouts persisted to `data/dashboard-layouts.json` via `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/dashboard/layouts`. Built-in layouts: `default` / `focus` / `morning-review` / `ops`. Keyboard-accessible editor with reorder + add/delete + rename + save-as-new. Palette integration: `⌘K` → any layout name switches instantly. See CLAUDE.md "Dashboard Widgets & Layouts" for the widget contract.
- **Ask Yourself — slice (a)** — `/ask` and `/ask/:conversationId` live. `server/services/askService.js` orchestrates parallel retrieval across memory (hybrid) + brain notes + autobiography + goals + calendar with kind-weighted reranking. Three modes (`ask` / `advise` / `draft`). API providers stream SSE; CLI providers single-shot. Conversations persist to `data/ask-conversations/` with 30-day auto-expiry. 40 new tests; suite stayed green.
- **God file decomposition** — `routes/cos.js` (28-line index + 6 modular route files), `routes/scaffold.js`, `client/api.js` (split into 19 focused api*.js modules), `services/digital-twin.js` (split into 10 focused modules), `services/subAgentSpawner.js` (slimmed from monolithic to 192 lines, logic extracted across helper modules).

## 2026-04-21

- **Better Audit remediation — security & overrides** — Added root-package `overrides` for `path-to-regexp` (^8.4.2), `lodash` (^4.18.1), `basic-ftp` (^5.3.0), `follow-redirects` (^1.16.0), `brace-expansion` (^5.0.5), `socket.io-parser` (^4.2.6); upgraded `react-router-dom` to 7.5.2.
- **Better Audit remediation — code/DRY/bugs** — `pgQuoteIdentifier` helper in `routes/database.js`; `escapeJql` in `services/jira.js`; `atomicWrite` extracted to `lib/fileUtils.js`; `dataManager.js` uses `PATHS.data`; `brain.js` setTimeout cleared on close/error; `telegramClient.js` polling retry with 5s backoff; `clinvar.js` 5-minute AbortSignal; `loops.js` floating promise caught + logged; `systemHealth.js` wrapped in `asyncHandler`; SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown in `server/index.js`; `agents.test.js` and `socket.test.js` rewritten against real exports; autofixer log statements gained emoji prefixes.
- **Test coverage** — `cosRunnerClient.test.js` (37 tests, 497 lines), `agentActionExecutor.test.js` (27 tests), CoS routes (170 tests across 6 test files, 83-100% route coverage).

## 2026-03-31

- **Depfree audit (heavy mode)** — Removed 13 of 15 targeted packages (`uuid`, `cors`, `axios`, `multer`, `unzipper`, `node-telegram-bot-api`, `supertest`, `geist`, `globals`, `fflate`, `react-markdown`, `react-diff-viewer-continued`, `react-hot-toast`). ~1,100 lines of owned replacement code across 9 new files (`server/lib/uuid.js`, `httpClient.js`, `multipart.js`, `zipStream.js`, `telegramClient.js`, `testHelper.js`; `client/src/components/ui/Toast.jsx`; etc.). `@dnd-kit/*` and `recharts` deferred — replacement effort exceeds 300-line heavy-mode ceiling.

## 2026-03-20

- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help Modal** — Press `?` to show all keyboard shortcuts; global overlay with section grouping, accessible dialog

---

## 2026-03-18

- Fixed PromptManager.jsx fetch calls — response.ok checks now present on all endpoints
- Fixed memory.js sort comparison — now type-safe with NaN/Date.parse validation
- Fixed silent catch in useTheme.js — now has console logging instead of swallowing errors
- Fixed agentActionExecutor.js:137 — reformatted complex ternary for readability
- Fixed memorySync.js `rows[0]` — added optional chaining with nullish coalescing fallback
- Fixed db.js `rows[0]` — added optional chaining with empty object fallback
- Resolved hardcoded localhost in lmStudioManager.js/memoryClassifier.js — server-side connections to local LM Studio with env var overrides, not a bug
- Resolved empty `.catch(() => {})` in client files — `request()` in api.js already shows `toast.error()` centrally; catches just prevent unhandled rejection warnings
- Resolved silent catches in runner.js — intentional best-effort writes during error handling
- Resolved Settings.jsx:366 catch — error toast already fires via centralized `request()` handler
- DRY: Extended PATHS object with 15 new centralized path constants in fileUtils.js
- DRY: Migrated 36 files from local `__dirname`/`process.cwd()` path definitions to centralized PATHS
- DRY: Replaced 57 `mkdir({recursive:true})` calls across 26 files with `ensureDir()`/`ensureDirs()`
