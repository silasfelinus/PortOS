# PortOS — Development Plan

For project goals, see [GOALS.md](./GOALS.md). For completed work, see [DONE.md](./DONE.md).

---

## Next Up

1. **Voice agent next power-ups** — `ui_read` (extract visible page text so "what does this say?" works without hand-navigation), destructive-action confirmation gate (pause and require spoken "confirm" when `ui_click` matches `/delete|remove|discard|reset|clear/i`), proactive CoS speech (server-pushed voice with quiet-hours policy + barge-in contract).
2. **Chronotype-aware CoS scheduling** — M42 ships chronotype derivation but `taskSchedule.js` still routes round-robin. Add a `temporalPreference` field to CoS task schema (`focus` / `low-energy` / `any`) and shift priority by time-of-day from the identity chronotype profile. Targeted addition (~150 lines), no new deps.
3. **God-file test coverage** — `cos.js` (3057 lines) and `agentLifecycle.js` (1283 lines) still have no test sibling. Add tests for `evaluateTasks` priority ordering + `dequeueNextTask` capacity guards (cos), and `spawnAgentForTask` + `handleAgentCompletion` error recovery (agentLifecycle).

## Backlog

### Creative Director follow-ups (post-#191 merge)

The PR landed with full pipeline mechanics + auto-recovery + smoke-test fixture, but the first real E2E run (1 of 6 scenes accepted on subjective grounds, 3 of 6 rejected, terminated cleanly) surfaced concrete improvement targets:

- [x] ~~**Multi-frame evaluator sampling.**~~ Done — `extractEvaluationFrames` in `server/lib/ffmpeg.js` probes total frames and uses ffmpeg `select='eq(n,0)+...'` to write `<jobId>-f1.jpg ... -f5.jpg`; `sceneRunner.handleRenderCompleted` calls it before enqueuing the evaluator and persists the basenames to `scene.evaluationFrames`; `buildEvaluatePrompt` now lists every sampled frame with timeline tags ("start (0%)", "~50% through", "end (~100%)") and instructs the agent to Read each one with explicit late-intent guidance. Falls back to single thumbnail when extraction fails.
- [ ] **i2v continuity fidelity.** `useContinuationFromPrior: true` currently feeds the prior scene's last frame as `sourceImagePath` but doesn't pin `imageStrength`. Renders sometimes drift hard from the seed (a "blue ball" continuation generates a totally new scene that loosely starts from the seed). Surface `imageStrength` as a per-scene knob in the treatment schema (default ~0.85 for continuation scenes, lower if the prompt deliberately changes the subject) and pipe it through `sceneRunner.params`.
- [ ] **Audio continuity across scenes.** mlx-video-with-audio generates audio per-clip; concatenated scenes have audible cuts at scene boundaries. Either render scenes silently and add a single backing audio pass at stitch time, or apply a short crossfade in `videoTimeline/local.js#buildFfmpegArgs` (already does video crossfades — extend to audio with `acrossfade`).
- [ ] **Duplicate evaluator spawn dedup.** During the long E2E run, server logs showed `Task already being spawned, skipping duplicate` followed seconds later by a *second* agent spawning for the exact same task id. The CoS task lane logic ends up double-acquiring. Reproduce in a unit test against `taskSchedule` / `agentLifecycle` and fix the de-dup window.
- [ ] **Render slowness on long sessions.** Per-scene render time degraded from ~3.5 min (early) to 10–30 min (late) within one project — likely accumulated listeners + queue races. Profile after sustained use; the round-22 dedup work probably already helps; verify.
- [x] ~~**Auto-accept watchdog.**~~ Done — `verifyVideoPlayable()` in `server/lib/ffmpeg.js` checks file-exists / size > 0 / ffprobe-can-read-at-least-1-frame. `sceneRunner.handleRenderCompleted` runs it before marking the auto-accept synthetic evaluation; on failure it routes to `handleRenderFailed` (which respects `MAX_SCENE_RETRIES`) instead of polluting the collection with a broken video. Falls back to file-exists/size checks only on hosts without ffprobe installed.
- [x] ~~**Smoke-test cost reduction.**~~ Done — dropped `durationSeconds` 3s→2s, added a hidden `1:1-small` (384×384) aspect preset for the smoke fixture only (kept out of `ASPECT_RATIOS` so the user-facing dropdown is unchanged). Smoke run now ~63% cheaper in pixel-frame terms. Lets pipeline health checks complete in render time only.

### LTX-2.3 dgrauet runtime — wire native modes

The dgrauet/ltx-2-mlx runtime now ships with FFLF (true keyframe interpolation) verified on hardware (commit `ef5d9081`). The pipeline supports more native modes that PortOS still emulates with workarounds — wiring each to the proper subcommand will materially improve quality. Helper script (`scripts/generate_ltx2.py`) already accepts the args; the gaps are server dispatch + client routing.

- [ ] **Native video Extend (replace chained-i2v workaround).** Today the UI's "Extend" mode extracts the last frame and runs i2v on it — visible motion stalls at every chunk seam. Dgrauet's `ExtendPipeline.extend_from_video()` conditions on the *whole input video's latent* (motion + visual content), so new frames flow naturally. Files (~70 LOC): (1) fix `scripts/generate_ltx2.py` `run_extend` to mirror cli's `_decode_and_save` cleanup pattern (free DiT+TextEncoder, load decoders on-demand, then save) — current implementation OOMs at decode; (2) `server/services/videoGen/local.js` `buildLtx2Args` route extend → helperMode='extend' on ltx2, take new `extendFromVideoPath` param + validate; (3) `server/routes/videoGen.js` accept `extendFromVideoId` in body, resolve to absolute video path under `data/videos/`; (4) `client/src/pages/VideoGen.jsx` when mode=extend AND selected model has runtime='ltx2' skip `extractLastFrame`, send `extendFromVideoId` instead — fall back to existing chained-i2v on legacy runtime. Plus tests for the route's id resolution. Validate on hardware with a known-motion source clip — extension should continue motion vs. start cold.
- [ ] **Audio-to-video (a2v).** Dgrauet ships a true audio-conditioned T2V pipeline (`AudioToVideoPipeline.generate_and_save` — takes a WAV/MP3 path + optional reference image, generates video that syncs to the audio). PortOS doesn't expose this today. Files (~120 LOC): (1) `scripts/generate_ltx2.py` add `run_a2v` that imports `AudioToVideoPipeline`, takes `--audio` (WAV/MP3), optional `--image` for I2V conditioning, emits same STAGE/STATUS protocol; (2) `data/media-models.json` no new model entry needed (uses same ltx2 runtime); (3) `server/lib/validation.js` extend video-gen schema with `mode: 'a2v'` enum value + `audioFile` field; (4) `server/routes/videoGen.js` add multipart audio upload (re-use `uploadSingle('audioFile', ...)` pattern from sourceImage), stage to `data/uploads/`, pass to enqueueJob; (5) `server/services/videoGen/local.js` `buildLtx2Args` map mode='a2v' → helperMode='a2v', pass `--audio <path>`; (6) `client/src/pages/VideoGen.jsx` add a new mode tile (icon: Music/Mic), audio file picker (no gallery — direct upload), maybe a duration display from probing the audio. Audio stripping (`--no-audio`) is a no-op in this mode (the audio IS the input). UAT: pick or upload a 4–8 second audio clip with clear rhythm + a directive prompt ("a person dancing to this track in a studio"), verify the rendered video's motion syncs to the audio's beats.
- [ ] **Native FFLF deeper test on real keyframe pairs.** FFLF wiring is verified on synthetic ball-motion keyframes (commit `ef5d9081`). Validate with REAL pairs: take last frame of clip A + first frame of clip B from the same scene/camera, render an interpolation, confirm temporally-coherent transition. If it looks weak even on similar keyframes, file a follow-up to expose more pipeline knobs in the UI (cfg-scale, stg-scale, stage1-steps).
- [ ] **Add UI hint under FFLF mode.** "Use keyframes that share scene geometry — same camera, same subject; the model interpolates between them. Random unrelated images produce a visual cut." Prevents the "looks like two stills" complaint that surfaced during testing.
- [ ] **Once dgrauet is the default for everything we care about, deprecate notapalindrome models.** Mark `ltx2_unified`, `ltx23_unified`, `ltx23_distilled_q4` with `deprecated: true` in `media-models.json` so the model dropdown groups them under a "Legacy" section. Eventually drop them and the `runtime: 'mlx_video'` dispatch entirely (~50 LOC removal in videoGen/local.js).

### Other backlog

- [ ] **Writers Room (Phase 2+)** — Phase 1 ships the authoring core (folders/works/drafts, "write for 10" exercise, version snapshots) under a new top-level `Create` sidebar group alongside Media Gen. Phases 2-5 cover manual AI analysis, Creative Director handoff, synced prose/script/media review, and realtime CD feedback. See [writers-room.md](./docs/features/writers-room.md).
- [ ] **Voice CoS tool expansion** — `calendar_today` / `calendar_next` (Google Calendar via existing MCP), `meatspace_log_workout` (wraps `meatspaceHealth.js`), `weather_now` (needs API choice — OpenWeather / WeatherKit / NWS), `timer_set` (reuses `agentActionExecutor.js` scheduled actions).
- [ ] **Voice agent vision fallback** — `ui_describe_visually` tool: screenshot the current tab (or a named canvas/chart) and send to a vision-capable model so "what's on this chart?" works on non-DOM content (CyberCity, graph views). Depends on a vision provider in `portos-ai-toolkit`.
- [ ] **Voice agent — explicit long-term memory routing** — On "remember that …", auto-route to `brain_capture` and inject top-N relevant memories into the voice turn's system prompt via `brain_search`. Some of this is ambient today; make it explicit and self-improving.
- [ ] **CyberCity v2** — Transform from decorative scene to interactive systems map. See [cybercity-v2.md](./docs/features/cybercity-v2.md). Phase 1 (operational legibility) underway: per-building health glyphs, "needs attention" pane, search overlay, status filter chips, clickable HUD stats, hover preview with quick actions, mobile/touch support.
- [ ] **M50 P9 — CoS Automation & Rules** — Automated email classification, rule-based pre-filtering, email-to-task pipeline.
- [ ] **M50 P10 — Auto-Send with AI Review Gate** — Per-account/per-recipient trust level + dual-LLM review (drafter + reviewer). Only auto-send when both approve or trust ≥ 0.9. See [Messages Security](./docs/features/messages-security.md).
- [ ] **M34 P5-P7 — Digital Twin** — Multi-modal capture (voice/video/image identity sources), advanced testing, personas. Ties to GOALS.md secondary "Multi-Modal Identity Capture".
- [ ] **Multi-reference image editing for FLUX.2** — Add a UI on the Image Gen page that accepts 2+ reference images plus an edit prompt (e.g. "put the subject from image A into the scene from image B"). When this lands, swap the model registry's 9B entry to [`black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B-kv`](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B-kv) — KV-cache optimization computes reference-image KV pairs once and reuses them across edits, giving up to 2.5× speedup on multi-reference workflows. Single-prompt / single-init paths see no benefit, which is why standard 9B is fine until then. Work involves: schema for multi-image payload (`referenceImages: [...]`), client multi-uploader, server FormData parsing, and adapting `flux2_macos.py` to call the multi-reference pipeline API. Separately-gated repo on HF — user must request access.

### Depfree Audit — 2026-04-28

All dependencies audited and justified. 0 removals. See [docs/DEPS.md](./docs/DEPS.md) for the full classification table and per-package rationale.

### Better Audit — pending (2026-04-21)

- [ ] **[HIGH][DRY]** `server/services/socket.js:595-814` — extract `broadcastToSet` + `registerSubscriber` to collapse 6× duplicated subscriber/broadcast boilerplate (also fixes missing `shellService.unsubscribeSessionList` on disconnect).
- [ ] **[HIGH][CODE]** `server/services/cos.js:3055` — remove `NODE_ENV !== 'test'` init guard (test-specific hack in prod).
- [ ] **[CRITICAL][TESTS]** `server/services/cos.js` and `server/services/agentLifecycle.js` — add test files (covered in Next Up #3).
- [ ] **[HIGH][TESTS]** Create test files for `server/services/clinvar.js`, `telegramBridge.js`.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM][CLIENT]** 8 client components redefine `formatBytes`/`formatTime`/`formatDuration`/`timeAgo`/`formatDate` locally; import from `client/src/utils/formatters.js`.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM][PERF]** `server/services/feeds.js:234-248` — full-sort-then-paginate on every request.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM][CODE]** Various magic numbers in `cos.js:166,357`, `lmStudioManager.js:66`; brittle `err.message.includes`/`startsWith` checks in `visionTest.js:124` and `routes/voice.js:160`.

### Deferred Architecture (human-led planning)

- `server/services/cos.js` (3057 lines) — split into cosTaskStore / cosTaskGenerator / cosJobScheduler / cosHealthMonitor.
- `server/services/agentLifecycle.js` (1283 lines) — extract prepareAgentWorkspace / resolveProvider / processCompletion.
- `server/services/identity.js` (1917 lines) — separate genomic markers + longevity + goals + todos.
- `server/services/taskSchedule.js` (2233 lines) — extract prompt management to `taskPromptService.js`.
- `server/services/socket.js` — split into domain-specific socket modules.
- `server/routes/apps.js` (1126 lines) — extract `npm install` orchestration to `appBuilder.js`.
- `client/src/components/goals/GoalDetailPanel.jsx` (1252 lines) — god component.
- `autofixer/ui.js` (972 lines) — inline HTML template needs extraction.
- API contract — standardize error response shapes (`asyncHandler` + `ServerError` everywhere).

**Known low-severity:** pm2 ReDoS (GHSA-x5gf-qvw8-r2rm) — no upstream fix, not exploitable via PortOS routes.
