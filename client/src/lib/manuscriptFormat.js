/**
 * Pure manuscript text normalizer for the Manuscript editor's "Format" button.
 *
 * The motivating mess: text pasted out of a PDF export arrives hard-wrapped at
 * the page margin (every visual line is a real `\n`), with stylized drop-caps
 * split onto their own line ("T\nhe dawn …"), words hyphenated across the wrap
 * ("approxi-\nmating"), and closing quotes orphaned from the text they
 * terminate (alone on a line, wrapped to the next line, or with a stray space
 * before them). `formatManuscript(text, stageId)` undoes those paste artifacts
 * so a paragraph reads as one logical line again.
 *
 * Two altitudes, chosen by stage:
 *   - prose  → full reflow: join soft-wrapped lines back into paragraphs, plus
 *     quote re-attachment.
 *   - comic / teleplay / anything else → conservative cleanup ONLY. Scripts
 *     carry meaning in their line breaks (scene headings, panel descriptions,
 *     character cues), so we never reflow or touch their quotes — we only fix
 *     the unambiguous artifacts (drop-caps, hyphen splits, trailing whitespace,
 *     blank-line runs).
 *
 * Reflow heuristic (the hard part — PDF paste usually has NO blank lines between
 * paragraphs, and a document is often a MIX of already-joined single-line
 * paragraphs and genuinely-wrapped ones, so a global line-width threshold is
 * unsound — it both pulls the next paragraph into a long complete one and fails
 * to recognize a wrapped line once a longer paragraph raises the bar):
 *   Join a line onto the previous one ONLY when it begins with a lowercase
 *   letter. A real sentence, paragraph, heading, or attribution never starts
 *   lowercase, so this is the one near-zero-false-positive signal. A
 *   capital/quote/dash start keeps its break — it might be a new paragraph, and
 *   a wrong join (merging two paragraphs or swallowing a heading) is far more
 *   destructive than leaving one extra break. Blank lines always separate
 *   paragraphs and are never crossed.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free (no DOM) so it runs in node test env too.
