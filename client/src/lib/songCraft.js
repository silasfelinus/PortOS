// Canonical a cappella song-craft reference data: dirge rhythm shapes, the
// layer-building ladder, a learning sequence, musical-notation help, and the
// movable-do solfège scale. The Songs Guide page renders directly from these
// arrays (rhythm shapes, layer ladder, learning steps, notation, solfège), and
// the Song editor reuses RHYTHM_SHAPES and VOICE_LAYERS for its picker options
// so the editor and the docs never drift. Keep this module pure (no React, no
// imports) — it is mirrored into the client lib barrel and unit-tested.

// --- Rhythm shapes ---------------------------------------------------------
// A "rhythm shape" is the felt pulse + note-length feel a song leans on. A
// dirge is a slow, solemn lament (funeral march, ballad of loss) — "500 Miles"
// by Peter, Paul and Mary sits in the slow-ballad / dirge family. `bpm` carries
// the typical tempo band, `feel` the conductor's count, and `count` a spoken
// counting pattern the singer can tap. `dirge` marks the shapes that suit a
// lament so the guide can highlight the slow family the user asked about.
