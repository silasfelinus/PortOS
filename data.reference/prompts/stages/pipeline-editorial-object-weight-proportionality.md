# Pipeline — Editorial Check: Object narrative-weight proportionality

You are a developmental editor doing a single focused pass for ONE problem:
**object weight-proportionality** — an object whose narrative weight (the depth
of backstory, lineage, and payoff the story invests in it) is out of proportion
to its prominence (how much the plot actually leans on it). The failure runs in
both directions:

- **Over-weighted** — a minor object the prose barely uses is handed a
  disproportionate backstory or significance: a one-line locket given a
  three-issue origin, a throwaway prop with a reverent history nothing pays off.
  The machinery is heavier than the moment it serves, so the setup feels like
  wasted load-bearing weight.
- **Under-established** — a prominent or decisive object carries little or no
  established lineage to earn its weight: an heirloom that resolves the finale
  but was never set up, a "legendary" relic the story treats as climactic
  without ever planting why it matters. The payoff outruns its setup, so the
  beat lands unearned.

Judge the *proportion* between weight and prominence — not the absolute amount of
either. A richly backstoried object that genuinely drives the plot is healthy; so
is a minor object with a light touch of significance. The problem is the
mismatch: heavy setup spent on a trivial object, or a pivotal object resting on
no setup at all.

## Established objects (canon)

These are the objects the canon records, with the significance and
character attachments already on file. Treat this as the *recorded* weight an
object carries going in; weigh it together with what the prose itself plants and
pays off. An object with deep canon significance and attachments but almost no
presence in the manuscript is a candidate for over-weighting; a manuscript-pivotal
object with thin canon significance and no on-page lineage is a candidate for
under-establishment.

```
{{objects}}
```

## Manuscript

The manuscript is stitched from the drafted issues. Each section begins with a
header like `# Issue 3 — Title (prose)`; use the issue number in that header to
attribute each finding to its `issueNumber`.

```
{{manuscript}}
```

## Task

Find the objects whose narrative weight and prominence are out of proportion. For
each, quote a short verbatim anchor from the text (≤ 200 characters), name the
issue number it appears in, classify the imbalance in the `location` (e.g.
`Issue 2 — over-weighted backstory`, `Issue 7 — under-established payoff`),
explain why the weight and prominence don't match, and suggest a concrete fix —
trim or cut the disproportionate setup, or plant the missing lineage earlier so a
pivotal object earns its moment. Set severity by how much the mismatch distorts
the story: a climactic object resting on no setup is more serious than a minor
prop with a slightly heavy backstory.

Do NOT flag: an object whose weight matches its role (well set up and genuinely
pivotal, or minor with a light touch); a deliberate red herring or
slow-burn mystery the story is actively and intentionally building toward; or an
object whose lineage is established off-page in canon and only lightly echoed in
prose by design.

Be specific and cite the text. If every object's weight is proportionate to its
prominence, return an empty `findings` array — do not invent issues.

## Output contract

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this shape — no prose, no markdown fence, no
commentary:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "issueNumber": 3,
      "location": "string — the imbalance + where (e.g. 'Issue 2 — over-weighted backstory')",
      "problem": "1–3 sentences naming the object and why its weight and prominence are out of proportion",
      "suggestion": "1–3 sentences proposing how to rebalance (trim the setup, or plant the missing lineage)",
      "anchorQuote": "short verbatim quote from the manuscript (≤ 200 chars)"
    }
  ]
}
