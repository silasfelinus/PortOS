# Pipeline — Editorial Check: Unmodeled proper nouns used as character names

You are a developmental editor doing a single focused pass for ONE concern:
**unmodeled character names** — capitalized proper nouns the prose uses as
apparent CHARACTER names that were never added to the story bible. Your job is to
surface them and CLASSIFY each one, because a deterministic name scan can't tell a
person from a place, an organization, a brand, or an honorific.

Flag this (one finding per distinct name):

- **Unmodeled named character** — a proper noun used as a person's name (someone
  speaks, acts, is addressed, or is referred to as a character) that is NOT in the
  known-characters list below. Name them so the author can decide: add to canon, or
  leave unnamed.

You do NOT need to judge how OFTEN a name appears — a deterministic pass counts
each surfaced name's appearances across the whole manuscript afterward and labels
one-appearance names as throwaways. Your job is only to find apparent character
names and confirm they are people (not the false positives below).

Do NOT flag:

- Any name in the known-characters list, or one of its listed aliases (those are
  already modeled — that's the whole point of the list).
- A proper noun that is clearly NOT a person: a place (city, country, building,
  region), an organization/faction/company, a brand/product, a title or honorific
  used without a name ("the Captain", "your Majesty"), a deity/abstraction, or a
  day/month. These are the false positives a deterministic scan can't rule out — it
  is YOUR job to exclude them.
- A descriptive epithet that functions as an unnamed role ("the stranger", "the
  old woman") — that is already unnamed, which is the fix we'd suggest anyway.

{{/knownCharacters}}
{{^knownCharacters}}
## Known characters

The story bible has no characters yet, so EVERY proper noun the prose uses as a
character name is unmodeled. Surface each named character you find (still excluding
places, organizations, brands, and bare honorifics).
{{/knownCharacters}}

## Manuscript

The manuscript is stitched from the drafted issues. Section headers attribute
each chunk to an issue (e.g. `# Issue 3 — Title (prose)`). Use the issue number
in each header to attribute every finding to its `issueNumber`.

```
{{manuscript}}
```

You may be seeing only one PART of a long manuscript reviewed in pieces. That's
fine — surface every unmodeled name you can see in this part. The "already
recorded" digest above (when present) lists unmodeled names earlier parts already
surfaced; do NOT repeat those.

## Task

Scan the prose for capitalized proper nouns used as apparent character names,
drop every one that is already in the known-characters list (name or alias) or is
clearly a non-person (place / organization / brand / bare honorific), and report
what remains — one finding per distinct name. For each finding set `location` to
`Unmodeled character — "Name"` (e.g. `Unmodeled character — "Marguerite"`); the
deterministic post-pass rewrites this to a throwaway/recurring label and sets the
final severity, so just use that one form and let `severity` be your best guess.
Quote a short verbatim anchor (≤ 200 chars) at the name's first use. If every
named character in the prose is already modeled (or the only unmodeled proper nouns
are places/orgs/brands/honorifics), return an empty `findings` array. Do not invent
names the prose doesn't use, and do not flag a name just because it is rare — only
because it is UNMODELED.

## Output contract

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this shape — no prose, no markdown fence, no
commentary:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "issueNumber": 3,
      "location": "string — always 'Unmodeled character — \"Name\"' (e.g. 'Unmodeled character — \"Marguerite\"'); the deterministic post-pass relabels throwaway vs recurring",
      "problem": "1–3 sentences naming the proper noun, why you classified it as a character (not a place/org/brand/honorific), and whether it recurs or appears only once",
      "suggestion": "1–3 sentences proposing how to resolve it (add to canon if it should matter, or recast as an unnamed description if it's a throwaway)",
      "anchorQuote": "short verbatim quote at the name's first use (≤ 200 chars)"
    }
  ]
}
```
