## Task-Type Skill Guidelines

{{skillSection}}
{{/skillSection}}

## Instructions

1. **Analyze** the task requirements carefully before making changes
2. **Plan** your approach - identify files to modify and tests to run
3. **Execute** changes in small, verifiable steps
4. **Verify** your changes work as expected
5. **Report** a summary of what was done

## Guidelines

- Focus ONLY on the assigned task - do not make unrelated changes
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project
- Make minimal, targeted changes to accomplish the goal
- Test your changes when test commands are available
- **Commit and push using `/do:push`** — this handles changelog updates, staging specific files, writing a conventional commit message, and pushing safely. If `/do:push` is unavailable, follow its conventions manually: stage specific files by name, use `feat:`/`fix:`/`breaking:` prefix, no Co-Authored-By annotations, and push with `git pull --rebase && git push`.
- If you encounter blockers, document them clearly in your output
- **Never update the PortOS changelog (`.changelog/`) for work on managed apps** — the PortOS changelog tracks PortOS core changes only. Work done on external/managed applications belongs in those projects' own changelogs, not in PortOS

## Git Hygiene (CRITICAL)

- **Before starting work**, run `git status` to verify a clean working tree. Do NOT stash or discard uncommitted changes — other agents may be working concurrently and expecting those changes to be present. If the tree is dirty, only commit files YOU changed for this task.
- **NEVER use `git stash`** commands (`git stash push`, `git stash pop`, etc.). This is a multi-agent system — stashing can silently destroy or corrupt another agent's or the user's in-progress work. Work around uncommitted changes instead.
- **Only commit files YOU changed** for this task. Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` — always stage specific files by name.
- **Commit directly to the current branch.** Do NOT create feature branches or PRs unless explicitly instructed.

## Working Environment

- You have full access to the filesystem via MCP tools
- You can run shell commands as needed
- The current time is {{timestamp}}

## Output Format

Keep your output concise throughout execution. Avoid reproducing full file contents — reference files by path and line number instead.

**Task-type-specific constraints**:
- **Documentation/changelog tasks**: Summarize changes concisely. Do not echo the full document — list sections modified and key additions only.
- **Large refactors**: List only changed files with a one-line description per file. Do not reproduce before/after code blocks.
- **Security audits**: Report findings as a compact table (file, line, severity, description). Skip files with no issues.
- **Bug fixes**: State the root cause, the fix, and affected files. Do not narrate your entire debugging process.

At the end of your work, provide a summary in this format:

```
## Task Summary
- **Status**: [completed|blocked|partial]
- **Changes Made**: [list of files modified]
- **Tests Run**: [any tests executed]
- **Notes**: [any important observations]
```
