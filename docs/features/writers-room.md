# Writers Room

## Intent

Writers Room is the PortOS workspace for creating, organizing, editing, analyzing,
and adapting literary works. It starts as a focused writing environment with
manual AI review actions, then grows into the story-to-media pipeline: prose to
script, script to character sheets and scene plans, scene plans to reference
images and video renders, and a synchronized review surface that keeps prose,
script, and media aligned.

The first version should support three jobs:

1. Manage writing projects: folders, works, drafts, versions, notes, and status.
2. Help the writer produce words: a "write for 10" exercise with timer, live
   word count, and progress tracking.
3. Run explicit AI passes over the current draft: summaries, character and scene
   extraction, expansion recommendations, prose-to-script adaptation, and media
   planning.

Realtime Creative Director feedback and background live analysis are intentionally
future work. In the first implementation, every AI evaluation and render action is
started by a user click.

## Baseline

`main` now contains both FLUX.2-klein image generation and the full Creative
Director / media-job-queue surface — `feat/creative-director` was squash-merged
as PR #191 (`9b36b900`). Phase 0 of this plan is therefore complete; Writers
Room implementation starts directly on `main`.

Reuse — do not rebuild — the existing image/video gen systems:

- `server/services/imageGen/` and `scripts/flux2_macos.py` for image renders.
- `server/services/videoGen/` for LTX/MLX video renders.
- `server/services/mediaJobQueue/` for serializing local image/video jobs.
- `server/services/creativeDirector/` for treatment/scene/run orchestration.
- `server/lib/mediaModels.js` as the source of truth for image/video models
  (including FLUX.2-klein image variants).

## Product Shape

### Navigation

Routes:

- `/writers-room` — Writers Room landing (library + editor)
- `/writers-room/works/:id` — Active work editor

Sidebar placement: a new top-level **Create** group that contains both
**Media Gen** (default landing for the group) and **Writers Room**. Creative
Director continues to live under `/media/creative-director` and is reachable from
Writers Room via the render-plan handoff. Configuration surfaces (Prompts,
Providers) stay under the existing **AI** group.

Add navigation entries in both places PortOS currently needs them:

- `client/src/components/Layout.jsx`
- `server/lib/navManifest.js`

### Primary Layout

The main Writers Room page should be a three-pane workspace:

- Left: library tree with folders, works, tags, status filters, recent drafts,
  and exercise sessions.
- Center: editor for the active draft, with title, metadata, save/version state,
  word count, and selected prose range.
- Right: action sidebar with manual AI tools grouped as Analyze, Adapt, Render,
  and Review.

The first editor can be a high-quality plain text or Markdown editor. Avoid a
rich-text dependency until formatting requirements justify it. The core needs are
stable text ranges, reliable word count, keyboard-friendly writing, and low risk
of corrupting large prose drafts.

### Writing Exercise

The "write for 10" section can live as a tab in Writers Room and as a quick action
from any work.

MVP behavior (ships in **Phase 1**):

- Configurable timer (5/10/15/25-min presets) with start, finish, and discard.
- Live word count of the sprint buffer, words added since session start.
- Session can start from a blank prompt or a selected work (free-write the
  current work's title appears as the implicit prompt).
- On finish, save the exercise session with starting/ending word counts and
  the appended sprint text.
- Track session history: date, duration, starting words, ending words, words
  added, linked work, and prompt.

Deferred to **Phase 2+** (NOT in Phase 1):

- Pause / resume mid-session (today's MVP is start/finish/discard only).
- Promote / append the sprint text into the active work's draft on finish
  (today the appendedText is logged with the session but not merged into the
  work). The session metadata already carries everything needed to wire this
  up later — surface a "Promote to draft" button on the recent-sessions list.
- Session can start from a selected prose segment (currently scopes to the
  whole work).

Do not blend this into POST yet. POST has creative writing drills, but Writers
Room needs an authoring-grade exercise log tied to works and drafts.

## Data Model

Use local, human-readable storage under `data/writers-room/`. Avoid one giant
JSON file for all prose. Store metadata as JSON and draft bodies as Markdown/text
files so long works remain manageable.

Recommended layout:

```text
data/writers-room/
  folders.json
  exercises.json
  works/
    <workId>/
      manifest.json
      drafts/
        <draftVersionId>.md
      analysis/
        <analysisId>.json
      render-plans/
        <renderPlanId>.json
```

### Folder

```json
{
  "id": "wr-folder-...",
  "parentId": null,
  "name": "Novel Drafts",
  "sortOrder": 0,
  "createdAt": "iso",
  "updatedAt": "iso"
}
```

### Work Manifest

The shape that ships in **Phase 1** (matches the on-disk file written by
`server/services/writersRoom/local.js`):

```json
{
  "id": "wr-work-...",
  "folderId": "wr-folder-..." or null,
  "title": "Working Title",
  "kind": "novel|short-story|screenplay|essay|treatment|other",
  "status": "idea|drafting|revision|adaptation|rendering|complete|archived",
  "activeDraftVersionId": "wr-draft-...",
  "drafts": [ /* see Draft Version */ ],
  "createdAt": "iso",
  "updatedAt": "iso"
}
```

**Phase 2+ planned (NOT yet persisted)** — added when the phase that uses
each field ships. Listed here so the data-model story stays continuous, but
the writer/validator drops them as YAGNI today:

```json
{
  "tags": [],
  "collectionId": "media-collection-id",
  "creativeDirectorProjectIds": [],
  "settings": {
    "defaultAnalysisProviderId": null,
    "defaultAnalysisModel": null,
    "defaultImageModelId": null,
    "defaultVideoModelId": null,
    "renderAspectRatio": "16:9",
    "renderQuality": "draft"
  }
}
```

### Draft Version

Draft metadata should be stored in `manifest.json`, with body text in
`drafts/<draftVersionId>.md`.

```json
{
  "id": "wr-draft-...",
  "label": "Draft 3",
  "contentFile": "drafts/wr-draft-....md",
  "contentHash": "sha256",
  "wordCount": 12842,
  "segmentIndex": [
    {
      "id": "seg-001",
      "kind": "chapter|scene|paragraph",
      "heading": "Chapter 1",
      "start": 0,
      "end": 1842,
      "wordCount": 312
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "iso",
  "createdFromVersionId": null
}
```

The segment index is the foundation for stale-analysis detection and synced
prose/script/media review. AI outputs should attach to a draft version and to
specific segment IDs or character offsets.

### Analysis Snapshot

AI evaluations are immutable snapshots tied to a draft version. If the draft
changes later, show them as stale rather than mutating them silently.

```json
{
  "id": "wr-analysis-...",
  "workId": "wr-work-...",
  "draftVersionId": "wr-draft-...",
  "kind": "summary|characters|scenes|suggestions|expansion|script|media-plan",
  "sourceRange": { "start": 0, "end": 1842, "segmentIds": ["seg-001"] },
  "providerId": "openai",
  "model": "selected-model",
  "status": "queued|running|succeeded|failed",
  "result": {},
  "error": null,
  "createdAt": "iso",
  "completedAt": "iso"
}
```

Expected result schemas:

- Characters: `characters[]` with name, aliases, role, goals, traits,
  relationships, visual spec, first-seen segment, and evidence snippets.
- Scenes: `scenes[]` with summary, location, time, characters, plot beats,
  emotional turn, adaptation notes, and suggested visual prompt.
- Summary: logline, short summary, detailed synopsis, themes, open questions.
- Suggestions: issue/recommendation list with target segment, rationale,
  severity, and optional replacement/continuation text.
- Expansion: continuation options, missing-scene opportunities, character
  deepening notes, pacing recommendations.
- Script: screenplay-style script segments mapped back to prose segment IDs.
- Media plan: character reference prompts, scene reference prompts, shot list,
  video prompts, and Creative Director handoff metadata.

## Backend Plan

### Services

Add `server/services/writersRoom/local.js` for file-backed CRUD and draft I/O.
Keep it the only writer for `data/writers-room/`, matching the pattern used by
Creative Director and Video Timeline.

Responsibilities:

- create/update/delete folders
- create/update/archive works
- read/write draft body files
- create draft versions and compute word count/content hash
- build/update segment indexes
- save immutable analysis snapshots
- save exercise sessions
- create media collections for works when needed
- link works to Creative Director projects, media collections, and timeline
  projects

Add validation in `server/lib/validation.js` or a dedicated
`server/lib/writersRoomValidation.js` if the schemas get large. Keep Zod schemas
strict at the route boundary.

### Routes

Add `server/routes/writersRoom.js`.

Suggested endpoints:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/writers-room/folders` | List folders |
| POST | `/api/writers-room/folders` | Create folder |
| PATCH | `/api/writers-room/folders/:id` | Rename/move folder |
| DELETE | `/api/writers-room/folders/:id` | Delete empty folder |
| GET | `/api/writers-room/works` | List work summaries |
| POST | `/api/writers-room/works` | Create work |
| GET | `/api/writers-room/works/:id` | Get manifest, latest draft metadata, latest analysis summaries |
| PATCH | `/api/writers-room/works/:id` | Update work metadata/status/settings |
| DELETE | `/api/writers-room/works/:id` | Archive or delete work |
| GET | `/api/writers-room/works/:id/draft` | Get active draft body |
| PUT | `/api/writers-room/works/:id/draft` | Save active draft body and update segment index |
| POST | `/api/writers-room/works/:id/versions` | Snapshot current draft as a new version |
| GET | `/api/writers-room/works/:id/analysis` | List analysis snapshots |
| POST | `/api/writers-room/works/:id/analysis` | Manually run an AI evaluation |
| GET | `/api/writers-room/analysis/:analysisId` | Get full analysis result |
| POST | `/api/writers-room/exercises` | Start or save exercise session |
| PATCH | `/api/writers-room/exercises/:id` | Finish/discard/update session |
| POST | `/api/writers-room/works/:id/render-plans` | Create media plan from script/scenes |
| POST | `/api/writers-room/render-plans/:id/creative-director` | Create/link Creative Director project |

Analysis can be synchronous for small drafts in v1, but the API should already
carry `status` so it can move to queued/background execution without changing the
UI contract.

### AI Evaluation Service

Add `server/services/writersRoom/evaluator.js`.

Use existing provider and prompt infrastructure instead of hardcoding prompts in
the route. Recommended prompt stages under `data.reference/prompts/stages/`:

- `writers-room-summary.md`
- `writers-room-characters.md`
- `writers-room-scenes.md`
- `writers-room-suggestions.md`
- `writers-room-expansion.md`
- `writers-room-script.md`
- `writers-room-media-plan.md`

Prompt outputs should be JSON-first and schema-validated before persistence. If
validation fails, save the failed analysis snapshot with the raw error and do not
modify the work.

Manual trigger rule:

- No automatic eval on every keystroke.
- No background eval on draft save.
- Buttons in the sidebar trigger exactly one analysis kind for the selected
  range or the active draft.

## Creative Director And Media Integration

### What To Reuse

From `feat/creative-director`:

- `server/services/creativeDirector/local.js` for project state.
- `server/services/creativeDirector/orchestrator.js` for next-task decisions.
- `server/services/creativeDirector/agentBridge.js` and
  `completionHook.js` for CoS task chaining.
- `server/services/mediaJobQueue/index.js` for serializing local image/video
  jobs and avoiding GPU/Metal contention.
- `server/routes/creativeDirector.js` and `server/routes/mediaJobs.js`.
- Creative Director detail UI concepts: treatment, segments, runs.

From latest `main`:

- `server/lib/mediaModels.js` as the source of truth for image/video models,
  including FLUX.2-klein image models.
- `scripts/flux2_macos.py` and `scripts/flux2_quantized.py`.
- `/api/image-gen/models`, `/api/video-gen/models`, media collections, media
  history, and video timeline routes.

### Merge Requirements

When merging Creative Director onto latest main:

- Preserve FLUX.2 model registry fields: `runner`, `quantization`, `repo`,
  `tokenizerRepo`, `basePipelineRepo`, and `isFlux2`.
- Preserve the FLUX.2 setup/status route and HF token/license messaging.
- Keep mediaJobQueue's `providedJobId` behavior for image/video generators so
  queued job IDs match SSE event IDs.
- Re-run and update tests around `imageGen`, `videoGen`, `mediaModels`, and
  `mediaJobQueue`.

### Writers Room Bridge

Writers Room should not duplicate Creative Director. It should create inputs for
Creative Director and link back to its outputs.

Bridge behavior:

1. User runs `media-plan` or `script` analysis on a work or selected range.
2. Writers Room stores a render plan mapped to draft segment IDs.
3. User clicks "Create Creative Director project".
4. Server creates a Creative Director project with:
   - work title as project name
   - selected prose/script as `userStory`
   - work/render style as `styleSpec`
   - selected video model/aspect/quality
   - a media collection shared with the work
5. Creative Director plans and renders only after the user starts it.
6. Writers Room stores the returned `creativeDirectorProjectId` and displays
   Creative Director treatment/scenes/runs inline or through deep links.

For character and scene reference images, use image generation directly through
the existing image-gen route and media job queue. FLUX.2-klein is an image model,
so it is best suited for character sheets, scene references, and mood frames.
Scene videos still go through the configured video model pipeline.

## Synchronized Review Surface

Add this after core analysis and Creative Director handoff are stable.

Goal: let the user see how a story maps across forms.

View modes:

- Prose only
- Script only
- Media only
- Prose + script
- Script + media
- Prose + script + media

Mapping model:

```json
{
  "proseSegmentId": "seg-001",
  "scriptSegmentIds": ["script-001"],
  "mediaSegmentIds": ["media-001"],
  "creativeDirectorSceneIds": ["scene-1"],
  "mediaRefs": [
    { "kind": "image", "ref": "character-ref.png" },
    { "kind": "video", "ref": "video-history-id" }
  ]
}
```

Behavior:

- Selecting prose highlights the mapped script and media.
- Selecting script scrolls prose and media to the mapped segments.
- Media cards show provenance: source prose segment, script segment, prompt,
  model, render job, and Creative Director scene/run when applicable.
- If the draft content hash differs from the analysis/render plan version, show
  stale badges and require a deliberate refresh.

## Frontend Plan

Add:

- `client/src/pages/WritersRoom.jsx`
- `client/src/services/apiWritersRoom.js`
- `client/src/components/writers-room/LibraryPane.jsx`
- `client/src/components/writers-room/WorkEditor.jsx`
- `client/src/components/writers-room/ExercisePanel.jsx`
- `client/src/components/writers-room/AiSidebar.jsx`
- `client/src/components/writers-room/AnalysisPanel.jsx`
- `client/src/components/writers-room/RenderPlanPanel.jsx`
- `client/src/components/writers-room/SyncedReview.jsx`

MVP UI states:

- Empty library
- Create folder/work
- Save draft pending/saved/error
- Unsaved changes
- Exercise running/paused/complete
- Analysis idle/running/succeeded/failed/stale
- Render plan not created/ready/linked/rendering/complete
- Creative Director linked project status

Keep the UI dense and tool-like. This is an authoring workspace, not a marketing
page. Use icons for manual actions, tabs for work surfaces, and fixed panes so
the editor does not jump when analysis cards update.

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 0 - Merge Foundation [DONE]

Completed by squash-merge of `feat/creative-director` (PR #191, commit
`9b36b900`) and the FLUX.2 work that landed alongside it. Image/video routes,
mediaJobQueue, FLUX.2 model registry, Creative Director routes/UI, and SSE
progress all ship on `main` today.

### Phase 1 - Writers Room Core

Goal: works can be created, organized, edited, saved, versioned, and exercised.

- Add storage service, validation, routes, and API client.
- Add `/writers-room` route and nav entries.
- Build library pane and editor.
- Add autosave or explicit save with visible dirty/saved state. Prefer explicit
  save for the first version unless the editor proves stable.
- Add "write for 10" exercise session flow.
- Add word count, selected-range count, and draft version snapshots.

Exit criteria:

- User can create a folder, create a work, write prose, save it, snapshot a
  version, and complete a 10-minute exercise.

### Phase 2 - Manual AI Analysis

Goal: the writer can trigger useful, reviewable AI passes against a draft or
selected segment.

- Add prompt stages and evaluator service.
- Add analysis sidebar buttons for summary, characters, scenes, suggestions,
  expansion, and script.
- Store immutable analysis snapshots tied to draft version/content hash.
- Render structured analysis panels with evidence and stale badges.
- Add "accept into notes" or "copy into draft" only as explicit actions.

Exit criteria:

- No AI pass runs without a click.
- A changed draft marks old analysis as stale.
- Character/scene/script outputs retain source segment mappings.

### Phase 3 - Media Planning And Creative Director Handoff

Goal: a work can become a media plan, reference images, and a Creative Director
project.

- Add media-plan analysis kind.
- Add render plan storage and UI.
- Generate character reference prompts and scene reference prompts.
- Queue selected image previews using configured image model, including FLUX.2
  where available.
- Create/link Creative Director projects from render plans.
- Show Creative Director treatment/scenes/runs inside Writers Room as linked
  project state.

Exit criteria:

- User can select a scene or range, create a media plan, generate reference
  images, create a Creative Director project, and start rendering from a manual
  action.

### Phase 4 - Synchronized Prose, Script, Media Review

Goal: the user can inspect the adaptation chain and see what maps to what.

- Build `SyncedReview` with prose/script/media panes.
- Add segment mapping storage and stale-state detection.
- Support scroll/selection sync between panes.
- Link media items to collection, history, Creative Director scene, and source
  prose/script.

Exit criteria:

- User can open one work and review prose, script, and generated media with
  visible mappings and provenance.

### Phase 5 - Realtime Creative Director Feedback

Goal: evolve from manual passes to controlled live assistance.

- Optional live story continuation suggestions while writing. **[shipped]**
- Optional render previews on selected scenes. *(planned)*
- Creative Director can propose next beats, alternate scenes, and visual
  treatments from the active cursor context. *(planned)*
- Add throttling, debouncing, budget controls, and explicit opt-in per work. **[shipped]**

This phase should wait until manual analysis quality, mapping, and render costs
are proven.

**Shipped (live continuation slice):** the editor has an opt-in "Live Director"
mode (per work, off by default) that, while the writer pauses, asks for 2–4
short continuation options from the prose around the cursor — beats to take,
ready-to-insert prose snippets, or dialogue lines. Suggestions surface in a side
panel; `prose`/`dialogue` options insert at the caret. Controls:

- Per-work opt-in toggle (work menu → "Enable live director").
- A client debounce after typing stops (`liveMode.debounceMs`, default 2.5s) so
  no call fires on every keystroke.
- A server-enforced daily call budget (`liveMode.dailyCallBudget`, default 100,
  `0` = unlimited) that rolls over at UTC midnight. Opt-in and budget are
  enforced server-side, not just in the UI — the debounce is convenience only.

Backed by the `writers-room-continue` prompt stage (quick tier) and
`server/services/writersRoom/liveDirector.js`; per-work live config persists on
the work manifest.

**Still planned for this phase:** live render previews on selected scenes from
the cursor context, and a Creative Director bridge that proposes next
beats/alternate scenes/visual treatments (injecting into a CD treatment) rather
than only prose continuations.

## Test Plan

Backend:

- Writers Room storage CRUD and atomic writes.
- Draft save/version/content-hash behavior.
- Segment index generation for headings, blank-line scenes, and paragraphs.
- Analysis snapshot validation and stale detection.
- Exercise session lifecycle.
- Creative Director project linking.
- Media job queue integration with image and video job owners.
- Route validation and error shapes.

Frontend:

- Library create/select/delete flows.
- Editor dirty/saved/error state.
- Exercise timer and word-count deltas.
- Analysis sidebar loading, success, failure, stale states.
- Render plan and Creative Director linked-project states.
- Mobile layout for the three-pane workspace.

Regression:

- `/media/image`, `/media/video`, `/media/creative-director`, `/media/timeline`,
  and `/media/collections` still work.
- `server/lib/navManifest.test.js` still passes after adding Writers Room nav.
- FLUX.2 setup/status remains visible and its unsupported LoRA constraints are
  still enforced.

## Non-Goals For MVP

- Realtime background evaluation while typing.
- Multi-user collaboration.
- Rich screenplay pagination/export.
- Automatic rewrite of user prose.
- Fully autonomous story-to-movie generation without manual gates.
- Database migration for writing content.
- Public sharing or publishing workflows.

## Resolved Review Questions

1. **Sidebar placement** — A new top-level `Create` group containing Media Gen
   (default landing) and Writers Room. Prompts and Providers stay under `AI`.
2. **Editor** — Plain Markdown for v1. Revisit when screenplay formatting needs
   pagination.
3. **"Write for 10" sessions** — Can start standalone or attached to a work.
   Default the new-session form to "attach to active work" when one is open.
4. **First media milestone** — Character/scene reference images first, then
   video previews via Creative Director handoff.
5. **Creative Director auto-continue** — Inherit Creative Director's existing
   behavior; do not add a Writers-Room-specific gate. The user already controls
   per-scene start/cancel from the CD detail page.
