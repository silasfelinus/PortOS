/**
 * Update five pipeline stage prompt templates that were updated in the
 * "length profile" feature (feat/pipeline-genconfig-length-cover).
 *
 * The prompts now carry `{{lengthTargets.*}}` variables so the idea, prose,
 * comic-script, and TV-script stages scale their beat counts, word targets,
 * and page/minute targets with the per-issue length profile picker instead of
 * using the old hardcoded numbers.
 *
 * Strategy — "unmodified-only" update:
 *   Each file is compared against the MD5 of the version that shipped before
 *   this feature landed (the "old shipped" hash). If the file on disk still
 *   matches that hash, the user hasn't customized it and we replace it with
 *   the current data.sample version. If the hash diverges (customized), we
 *   skip and warn so the user can merge manually.
 *
 * Idempotent — a re-run that finds the current data.sample hash on disk
 * is a no-op.
