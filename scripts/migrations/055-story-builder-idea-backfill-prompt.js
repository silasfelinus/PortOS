/**
 * Add the optional `{{sourceMaterial}}` backfill block to the Story Builder
 * idea-expand prompt.
 *
 * The Story Builder can now reverse-engineer the starting idea from a series'
 * existing issue content (the "started from a drafted comic script" case). When
 * the user backfills the idea step, the conductor passes the concatenated issue
 * corpus as `sourceMaterial`; the prompt renders it under a new section and is
 * told to extract the premise already on the page. The forward (seed-only) path
 * is unchanged — the section only renders when `sourceMaterial` is non-empty.
 *
 * `scripts/setup-data.js` only copies *missing* prompts, so existing installs
 * keep their old template until this migration rewrites it. Customization-safe:
 * only an install whose copy still hashes to the known pre-change shipped
 * version is auto-updated; a customized prompt is left intact and warned about.
 *
 * Strategy: hash-driven prompt-replace via `./_lib.js`. Idempotent.
