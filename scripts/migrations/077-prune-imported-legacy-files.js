/**
 * Registration stub for the legacy file→Postgres artifact prune.
 *
 * Every file→DB migrator (universes, pipeline-issues/series, story-builder,
 * writers-room, creative-director) renames its source aside — `.imported` /
 * `index.json.imported` / `manifest.imported.json` — and the split migrations
 * (034–036) left `.bak-NNN` copies, kept "as a recovery source for at least one
 * release." Nothing ever removed them, so they linger in ./data (multiple MB on
 * a long-lived install) and ride into every rsync snapshot even though the
 * authoritative copy is now in Postgres + the pg_dump.
 *
 * The actual prune reads Postgres row counts (to confirm the DB is authoritative
 * before deleting a recovery copy), but the `scripts/migrations/` runner runs
 * BEFORE the DB pool is up — the same reason migrations 048–053 are boot-time +
 * stub-registered. So the prune runs at boot from
 * `server/scripts/pruneImportedLegacyFiles.js` (after ensureSchema + every
 * store's file→DB warm import), marker-gated in `data/legacy-prune.applied.json`,
 * with a count-vs-marker guard that withholds deletion when the live row count
 * is short of what the migration marker recorded (wiped / restored DB).
 *
 * This stub exists so the change is registered the standard way — it lands in
 * `data/migrations.applied.json` so the migration ledger and `git log` show when
 * the artifact prune was introduced.
 *
 * No-op + idempotent: nothing to do in the file runner.
