/**
 * Migration 081 — bring the Daily Log (journals) and Inbox into brain peer-sync.
 *
 * Both stores were previously OUTSIDE the brain entity-store contract, so neither
 * ever entered the sync log — they silently never federated across peers:
 *   - The Daily Log lived in journals.json with the right `{ records: { date: e } }`
 *     SHAPE, but its entries were written by a separate brainJournal store that
 *     never called brainSyncLog.appendChange, and `journals` wasn't in
 *     BRAIN_ENTITY_TYPES, so even a received entry would be dropped on apply.
 *   - The Inbox lived in inbox_log.jsonl, an append-only JSONL with no id-keyed
 *     map, no updatedAt LWW clock, and no tombstones.
 *
 * brainStorage now lists `journals` and `inbox` in BRAIN_ENTITY_TYPES as ordinary
 * `{ records: { id: record } }` stores. This migration reshapes the on-disk data
 * to match that contract so existing entries sync going forward:
 *
 *   1. journals.json — STRIP the inner `id` field from each entry (the map key is
 *      the record id now, and an inner `id` would clobber the date key that
 *      getById re-attaches), STRIP the machine-local `obsidianPath`/
 *      `obsidianVaultId` into a non-synced sidecar (journal-obsidian-locations.json
 *      — federating them would poison the reconcile checksum across peers with
 *      different vaults and break local mirror cleanup), then stamp the sync
 *      fields (originInstanceId + createdAt/updatedAt fallbacks) any entry is missing.
 *   2. inbox_log.jsonl → inbox.json — re-key each JSONL row by its `id` into a
 *      records map, drop the now-redundant inner `id`, and stamp the same sync
 *      fields (createdAt/updatedAt seeded from capturedAt so the LWW clock is
 *      meaningful). The old .jsonl is renamed aside (.migrated) as a recovery
 *      copy rather than deleted.
 *   3. memory-bridge-map.json — the brain→memory vector bridge keys each
 *      vectorized journal as `journals:<innerUuid>`. Now that the journal record
 *      id is the DATE, re-key those entries to `journals:<date>` using the inner
 *      uuid we strip in step 1. Without this, the next edit to an existing day
 *      computes the new date-key, finds no match, and mints a DUPLICATE memory
 *      entry — orphaning the uuid-keyed one. (Inbox is not vectorized, so it has
 *      no bridge entries to remap.)
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running finds the inner `id` already stripped and the sync
 * fields already present, and skips a missing/renamed inbox_log.jsonl. The wire
 * format is the standard entity-store record, so no schemaVersion bump is needed
 * — but a peer still on pre-081 code simply won't have `journals`/`inbox` in its
 * BRAIN_ENTITY_TYPES and will skip those records on apply (forward-compatible).
 *
 * Runs in the boot-time migration runner, BEFORE the service layer is wired up,
 * so it reads the instance id straight from data/instances.json and rewrites the
 * JSON files directly.
