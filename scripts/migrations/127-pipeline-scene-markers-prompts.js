/**
 * Introduce scene markers across the pipeline's text-stage prompts so a single
 * canonical scene list flows from the beat sheet down to the comic pages.
 *
 * Three prompts change:
 *   - `pipeline-idea-expansion.md` (beat sheet) gains a `## Scenes` section —
 *     the canonical numbered scene list (`Scene N — INT./EXT. LOCATION — TIME`)
 *     that every downstream adaptation inherits.
 *   - `pipeline-prose.md` is told to reuse the beat sheet's scene numbers +
 *     sluglines verbatim rather than re-deriving them.
 *   - `pipeline-comic-script.md` tags each page header `## Page N — Scene M:
 *     SLUGLINE`, so the comic-page parser can record per-page scene info and
 *     the render path can chain renders within a scene but break across one
 *     (don't reference the prior page across a scene cut).
 *
 * Strategy: hash-driven prompt-replace via `./_lib.js`. Idempotent. Existing
 * installs that already applied the earlier prompt migrations sit on the prior
 * shipped hashes below; this migration carries them forward to the scene-marker
 * versions. (The earlier migrations in this file's lineage were resynced to the
 * same new hashes so their drift-catch tests keep passing.)
