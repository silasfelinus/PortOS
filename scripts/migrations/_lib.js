 * - `createIfMissing` — when the data-side file is absent, copy the sample
 *   file in. Used by migration 005, whose `pipeline-arc-resolve.md` may not
 *   have shipped in `data.sample/` yet at the time it was authored.
 *
 * - `retireOnSampleMissing` — when the sample-side file is absent (the prompt
 *   was renamed or retired by a later commit), treat it as a soft delete:
 *   unlink the data-side file when it still matches an accepted-old hash,
 *   and warn (counting as `skipped`) when it's been customized. Without this
 *   flag, a missing sample raises an ENOENT at read time. Used by migration
