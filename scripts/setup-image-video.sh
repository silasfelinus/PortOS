#   INSTALL_FLUX2  '1' to also bootstrap a separate venv at ~/.portos/venv-flux2 for FLUX.2-klein (default: 1 on macOS, 0 elsewhere)
#   INSTALL_MUSICGEN '1' to bootstrap a venv at ~/.portos/venv-musicgen + clone ml-explore/mlx-examples to ~/.portos/mlx-examples for local MusicGen (MLX) background-music generation (pipeline audio stage). Default: 0; opt in with INSTALL_MUSICGEN=1 (macOS / Apple Silicon only).
#   MLX_EXAMPLES_PIN  commit SHA of ml-explore/mlx-examples to check out for MusicGen (default: main).
#   INSTALL_AUDIOLDM2 '1' to bootstrap a venv at ~/.portos/venv-audioldm2 (torch + diffusers) for local AudioLDM2 long-form background-music generation (pipeline audio stage, second backend alongside MusicGen). Default: 0; opt in with INSTALL_AUDIOLDM2=1 (runs on MPS / CUDA / CPU).
#   INSTALL_ACESTEP '1' to bootstrap a venv at ~/.portos/venv-acestep (torch + the acestep package) for local ACE-Step full-song generation with vocals (Music studio, third backend). Default: 0; opt in with INSTALL_ACESTEP=1 (runs on MPS / CUDA / CPU; checkpoints auto-download to ~/.cache/ace-step on first run).
