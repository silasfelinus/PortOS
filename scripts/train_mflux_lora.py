"""mflux FLUX.2 LoRA training wrapper (PortOS).

Wraps mflux's own trainer (`mflux-train`, mflux ≥0.17 — FLUX.1 training
was removed upstream) in a subprocess and translates its native output
into the PortOS trainer line protocol (see train_flux2_lora.py header /
server/services/loraTraining/progress.js). We deliberately do NOT import
mflux's training internals in-process — their API churns across versions;
the CLI + config JSON is the stable surface (same wrap-don't-import
strategy as generate_wan22.py).

Verified against mflux 0.17.5:
  - CLI: `mflux-train --config <json>` (resume: `--resume <checkpoint.zip>`).
  - Progress: a tqdm bar over total iterations (epochs × images), written
    with carriage returns — the reader splits on \\r AND \\n.
  - Outputs under the config's checkpoint.output_path:
      checkpoints/NNNNNNN_checkpoint.zip   (adapter + optimizer + config)
      preview/NNNNNNN_preview_*.png        (when monitoring is enabled)
      loss/loss.html
  - The trained adapter inside each zip is `NNNNNNN_adapter.safetensors`
    with diffusers-style key naming (`transformer.<module>.lora_A.weight`),
    so the extracted file loads directly in diffusers flux2 pipelines.

SIGTERM → forwarded to the mflux child; exit 143 after it stops (mflux
checkpoints at save_frequency boundaries; mid-interval cancels keep the
last saved checkpoint).

Segmented training (watchdog-panic mitigation). When `--segment-steps N`
is passed (>0), the run is broken into N-step segments instead of one
sustained mflux process: train to a checkpoint boundary, **terminate the
mflux child so its Metal/GPU context is fully torn down**, sleep
`--cooldown-sec` to let the GPU clock down + the system settle, then
`--resume` the newest checkpoint for the next segment. mflux resume reads
`num_epochs` from the checkpoint (the config value is ignored on resume),
so each segment continues toward the *same* total — segmentation is
numerically equivalent to one continuous run, just with periodic
full-process teardown. This directly attacks the macOS GPU
watchdog-timeout kernel panics that hard-reboot the machine during long
sustained mflux runs (see docs/research/2026-06-13-mflux-training-watchdog-panic.md):
sustained GPU pressure never spans more than one segment, and any
accumulated driver/thermal state resets between segments. `--segment-steps 0`
(the default) restores the single-process behavior.
