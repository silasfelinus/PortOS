/**
 * Shared streaming ANSI / control-byte stripper.
 *
 * PTY output arrives in arbitrary chunks. A CSI/OSC escape sequence can split
 * across two reads (e.g. `\x1B[` ends one chunk, `2J` starts the next) and a
 * naive per-chunk strip would leak the body of unterminated sequences into
 * the cleaned stream. This helper buffers a trailing fragment if it looks
 * like an incomplete escape and prepends it to the next chunk before
 * stripping, so split sequences resolve cleanly.
 *
 * Returns a stateful stripper function — instantiate one per stream.

// OSC alternative comes first so a complete `\x1B]<body>(BEL|ST)` sequence is
// consumed whole. The single-byte class `[@-Z\\-_]` covers 0x40-0x5A and
// 0x5C-0x5F, which includes `]` (0x5D); if it ran first it would strip the
// `\x1B]` opener only and leak the body+terminator. The bare `\x1B]` (no
// terminator) case still falls through to the single-byte branch.
//
// Body alternation `[^\x07\x1B]|\x1B(?!\\)` stops greedy matching at the
// FIRST `\x1B\\` (ST terminator). A naive `[^\x07]*` would otherwise prefer
// the latest possible ST and swallow visible text between two adjacent
// OSC sequences (e.g. `\x1B]a\x1B\\VISIBLE\x1B]b\x1B\\` → `` instead of
// `VISIBLE`). Each character produces at most one alternative attempt, so
// the alternation does not introduce catastrophic backtracking.
