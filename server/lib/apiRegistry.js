/**
 * Public API registry — the single source of truth for which PortOS services
 * are usable as externally-callable HTTP APIs.
 *
 * One declaration here drives THREE consumers, so they can never drift:
 *   1. `authGate` (server/lib/authGate.js) — when the PortOS password is on, an
 *      entry that is `exposed && !requireAuth` re-opens ONLY its `publicPrefixes`
 *      so external callers can reach it without a session.
 *   2. The Settings UI (VoiceTab + the API Access page) — renders the per-API
 *      `exposed` / `requireAuth` toggles via `resolveApiAccess()`.
 *   3. The OpenAPI spec builder (server/lib/openapiSpec.js) — documents each
 *      exposed API's `docPaths`.
 *
 * SECURITY INVARIANT: `publicPrefixes` lists ONLY read/compute-safe surfaces.
 * Config-mutation / process-control routes (e.g. `/api/voice/config`,
 * `/api/voice/whisper`) are deliberately NOT listed here and stay gated. The
 * voice API uses a dedicated `/api/voice/public/*` mount precisely so the
 * public surface is an explicit allowlist that cannot accidentally grow when a
 * new route is added to the main `/api/voice` router.
 *
 * Per-API runtime state (`exposed`, `requireAuth`) lives in the top-level
 * `apiAccess` settings key — NOT under `secrets` (which is stripped from
 * GET /api/settings), so the client can read these flags to render toggles.
