/**
 * PortOS schema-version contract for cross-instance sync.
 *
 * Two PortOS instances that exchange data (federated peer push, snapshot
 * sync, share-bucket manifests) need a way to detect a version mismatch
 * BEFORE applying records the receiver can't parse. Without this, an
 * upgraded sender silently corrupts a downstream peer whose code doesn't
 * yet understand a new storage layout.
 *
 * `PORTOS_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` is the per-sync-category WIRE contract — distinct
 * from the storage-layout version stamped on `data/{type}/index.json` (see
 * each service's local `TYPE_SCHEMA_VERSION` const). Bump the wire contract
 * for either:
 *   (a) a storage layout change (e.g. universes 4→5 splitting out of the
 *       monolithic JSON), OR
 *   (b) an additive record-shape change that a not-yet-upgraded peer would
 *       silently strip on round-trip (e.g. pipelineSeries 1→2 for the
 *       `series.arc.readerMap` field).
 * For (a) ship the corresponding `scripts/migrations/NNN-…js` to update the
 * stamped storage version too; for (b) the local storage layout stays put.
 * The number flows through every outbound payload's `portosMeta.schemaVersions`;
 * receivers compare incoming vs local and reject ahead-mismatches (sender too
 * new) or behind-mismatches (sender too old to satisfy a forward-only field).
 *
 * Absent categories default to 0 — the comparator treats 0 as "no check"
 * so historical / un-versioned data categories pass through unchanged.
 * Future PRs that introduce a layout change for `series`, `issues`, etc.
 * add an entry here.

  // v1 = creative ingredients catalog (Postgres tables: catalog_scraps,
  // catalog_ingredients, catalog_ingredient_sources, catalog_ingredient_refs).
  // v2 = `catalog_ingredients.search_tsv` expanded to also index the
  // character canon fields (physicalDescription, personality) and the
  // type-specific role/motivations/significance fields, so bible-promoted
  // characters become searchable on their main narrative text. The schema
  // is a DROP+re-ADD of the STORED generated column (Postgres can't ALTER
  // its expression); applied in lockstep by `ensureSchema`.
  // v3 = `catalog_ingredient_refs` gained `deleted`/`deleted_at` soft-delete
  // tombstones + an UPDATE trigger that bumps sync_sequence on delete/revive.
  // Older peers (≤v2) hard-DELETE on unlink and never tombstone, so the
  // version gate prevents a v3 receiver from accepting an older sender's
  // payload that would silently miss tombstones.
  //
  // Per-category gate so a new peer can sync its catalog independently of
  // whether other categories are version-locked. Older peers are
  // sender-behind on `catalog` (not ahead), so the receiver still accepts
  // their pushes; newer peers pushing to older receivers are sender-ahead
  // and get 412. `cat-ingredient` and `cat-scrap` record kinds map back
  // here via RECORD_KIND_SCHEMA_CATEGORIES.
  catalog: 3,
  // NOTE: `videoHistory` is intentionally NOT listed here. The version gate
  // rejects the ENTIRE snapshot/push payload on ANY ahead-mismatch (the
  // comparator walks the union of keys), so declaring a brand-new key would
  // make every not-yet-upgraded peer reject ALL categories (universe,
  // pipeline, …) — severing sync across a federation that upgrades on
  // independent schedules. videoHistory is a flat append-only array merged by
  // id with LWW-on-createdAt; the merge already tolerates unknown/extra rows,
  // so it does not need whole-payload gating. An older peer that lacks the
  // `videoHistory` route simply rejects that one category request and keeps
  // syncing everything else.
  //
  // The gate is now PER-CATEGORY (see `scopeVersionDiff` below + its three
  // call sites: dataSync `applyRemote`, peerSync push, sharing importer), so
  // adding a new key here or bumping one category only gates transfers of
  // THAT category — unrelated categories keep flowing. videoHistory stays
  // unlisted because it has no versioned storage layout at all, not because
  // of the old whole-payload footgun.
