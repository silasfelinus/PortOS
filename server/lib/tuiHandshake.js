// regex never matches. Once ANSI is stripped the cursor moves vanish and the
// glyphs collapse adjacent → `[Pastedtext#1+35lines]`. So the pattern tolerates
// arbitrary (including zero) whitespace between tokens and is case-insensitive,

// "The model is actively processing a submitted prompt" signal. A TUI repaints

// agent as `success: idle-complete` (issue #1229).
//
// We key on the TUI's elapsed-time WORKING COUNTER — `(1s · …` (Claude Code) /
// `(57s • …` (Codex) — which renders only while a request is in flight and
// INCREMENTS as the model works. This is the most model-agnostic signal (present
// in both providers, absent on the stuck screen) AND the only one that's
// echo-proof. The prompt is echoed into the input box BEFORE submission (and
// `promptSentAt` is set when the paste starts, before Enter), so word-matching
// `thinking`/`esc to interrupt` — or even a bare `(5s)` — could be tripped by a
// task description that merely contains those tokens (both flagged in review of
// #1229). Two defenses make the counter immune to the echo:
//   1. We require the counter's trailing bullet separator (`· ` / `• `, U+00B7 /
//      U+2022) — `(\d+s` alone matches log lines and durations in prose, but
//      `(\d+s ·` is the TUI's specific status-line format and effectively never
//      appears in a pasted prompt. (The bullet survives ANSI stripping intact —
//      verified in real transcripts: `(1s · thinking…`.)
//   2. We require ≥ MIN_WORK_COUNTER_SAMPLES DISTINCT second-counts — the live
//      counter passes through many values; a static echoed literal is just one.
// There is one residual echo vector even with the bullet requirement: a task
// that asks the agent to ANALYZE A TUI TRANSCRIPT can paste content that itself
// contains two distinct bulleted counters (`(1s · …` and `(2s · …`), and the
// whole prompt is echoed at paste time — before Enter is known to have submitted
// (flagged in review of #1229). The defining difference is TIMING: the live
// counter is rendered ONE value at a time as wall-clock seconds pass, whereas an
// echoed transcript's counters all arrive together in the paste render. So the
// tracker activates only once it has seen ≥ MIN_WORK_COUNTER_SAMPLES distinct
// values whose observations SPAN ≥ MIN_WORK_COUNTER_SPAN_MS of real time — a
// span a single paste-render burst can't fake. `observe()` therefore takes the
// current timestamp.
// Verified against real transcripts: the working run cycled through many counter
// values across its runtime; the two confirmed stuck runs (`agent-92ed2c56`,
// `agent-30a3ab56`) had none. Heuristic by nature, so it gates only the FALLBACK
// idle-complete path on the long-running agent path — the authoritative success
// signal remains the `.agent-done` sentinel. (The one-shot runner is deliberately
