/**
 * One-time importer: data/creative-director-projects.json → PostgreSQL
 * (creative_director_projects), for Phase 3 / issue #997.
 *
 * Creative Director projects used to live in a single JSON array. As of #997
 * they live one-row-per-project in Postgres. On the first PG-backed init (from
 * services/creativeDirector/local.js, BEFORE the boot recovery scan reads any
 * project), this importer copies each legacy project into the table.
 *
 * Idempotency / safety:
 *   - Marker-gated in data/creative-director-projects.migrated.json (mirrors
 *     the migrateBibleToCatalog marker convention) so the walk runs once.
 *   - INSERT … ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING — a project already in the table
 *     (e.g. a partial prior run, or a row created after the JSON was written)
 *     is never clobbered. The DB row is authoritative once it exists.
 *   - The legacy JSON is RENAMED to .imported (not deleted) so it remains a
 *     recovery source for at least one release (per the plan's Phase 5 note),
 *     and so a re-run can't re-import stale rows over fresher DB state.
 *   - The import is LOSSLESS: each project is copied verbatim, runs[] included.
 *     Trimming the runs[] cap is the LIVE store's job (projectsDB.persist /
 *     projectsFile.saveAll both call trimRuns on the next write) — doing it here
 *     would silently drop run history the file still holds. A legacy over-cap
 *     array shrinks on the project's first post-import write instead.
 *
 * NOT marker-gated via data/migrations.applied.json: that list is driven by the
 * prompt-replace runner under scripts/migrations/ and runs at a different boot
 * phase (before the DB gate). This import must run only when Postgres is the
 * confirmed-healthy backend, so it's gated on its own marker and invoked from
 * the backend selector instead.
