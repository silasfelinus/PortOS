/**
 * One-time cleanup: prune the legacy file→Postgres migration artifacts that the
 * file→DB migrators intentionally park aside instead of deleting.
 *
 * Every file→DB migrator (migrateUniversesToDB, migrateIssuesToDB,
 * migrateSeriesToDB, migrateStoryBuilderToDB, migrateWritersRoomToDB,
 * migrateCreativeDirectorToDB) renames its source aside — `…​.imported` /
 * `index.json.imported` / `manifest.imported.json` — and the split migrations
 * (034–036) left `…​.bak-NNN` copies, "a recovery source for at least one
 * release." Nothing ever removed them, so on a long-lived install they linger in
 * `./data` indefinitely (multiple MB) and ride along into every rsync snapshot
 * even though the authoritative copy is now in Postgres + the pg_dump. This
 * removes them once the DB is provably authoritative.
 *
 * WHY THIS RUNS AT BOOT (not in scripts/migrations/): the prune reads Postgres
 * row counts, but the `scripts/migrations/` runner executes BEFORE the DB pool
 * is up. So — exactly like repairUniverseTags / reconcileCanonCatalog — the real
 * work runs here from server/index.js (after ensureSchema + every store's
 * file→DB warm import), and scripts/migrations/077-prune-imported-legacy-files.js
 * is a registration stub so the change still lands in the migration ledger.
 *
 * SAFETY — the count-vs-marker guard (avoids the .length-truthiness footgun in
 * CLAUDE.md). A domain is pruned only when:
 *   (1) its `<domain>.migrated.json` marker exists (the migrator stamped it ONLY
 *       after a successful import + rename), AND
 *   (2) the live DB row count is >= the `imported` count the marker recorded.
 * "Table non-empty" would be WRONG: an install with genuinely zero records
 * (imported:0) would never prune its empty `.imported` dir and would re-walk
 * every boot forever. Comparing against the marker's recorded count instead
 * prunes the empty case (0 >= 0) while still WITHHOLDING when the marker says
 * `imported:13` but the table has 0 rows — the signature of a wiped / restored
 * DB, where the `.imported` files are the only remaining recovery source and
 * must NOT be deleted. This whole repair is also gated upstream by the
 * `dbReady` block in server/index.js, so it never runs under the
 * MEMORY_BACKEND=file escape hatch (no DB → no prune → recovery files kept).
 *
 * File-split backups (037 history.json, 059 media-collections.json) are NOT a
 * Postgres move — their successors live on disk — so they use a successor-exists
 * gate instead of a row count.
 *
 * Idempotent: `rm({ recursive: true, force: true })` no-ops on already-removed
 * paths, and a marker in `data/legacy-prune.applied.json` skips the walk once a
 * clean, complete pass has run. The marker is WITHHELD if any domain was blocked
 * (marker present but row count short) so a future boot retries that domain.
