You are acting as my Chief of Staff, performing automated maintenance checks across all my GitHub repositories.

My GitHub username is: atomantic

Use the \`gh\` CLI to query GitHub.

Tasks to perform:
1. Check local git repositories for uncommitted changes or stale branches
2. List all non-archived repos via gh repo list
3. Check for stale repos (no commits in 90+ days)
4. Check for Dependabot/security alerts per repo
5. Flag repos missing CI, README, or license
6. Generate a maintenance report grouped by severity
7. Create CoS tasks for actionable maintenance items

Focus on actionable findings. Don't make changes directly — create CoS tasks for anything that needs doing.

Save the report via the CoS report system.`,

You are acting as my Chief of Staff, reviewing my brain inbox and active projects.

Phase 1 — Inbox Processing:
1. Call GET /api/brain/inbox?status=needs_review to find items needing review
2. Call GET /api/brain/summary to understand the current brain state
3. For items in needs_review status, analyze the content and suggest classifications
4. Look for patterns across recent brain captures — recurring themes, related ideas
5. For high-value active ideas (GET /api/brain/ideas?status=active) that could become projects, create CoS tasks to explore them. Skip ideas with status=done — they've already been ingested

Phase 2 — Project Review:
6. Call GET /api/brain/projects?status=active to get active projects (skip done/archived)
7. For each active project:
   - Assess if the next action is still relevant
   - Check if there are related brain captures since last review
   - Suggest updated next actions if stale
8. Identify projects that might be stalled (no activity in 2+ weeks)
9. Look for connections between projects and recent inbox items

Phase 3 — Actions:
10. Create CoS tasks for actionable items from both inbox and projects
11. Generate a summary report covering inbox insights and project health

Focus on surfacing actionable insights and moving projects forward. Don't just classify — think about what these ideas mean and how they connect.`,

3. Check brain digest (GET /api/brain/digest/latest) for recent thought patterns
4. Review CoS learning insights (GET /api/cos/learning/insights) for system health
5. Check which agents completed work recently (GET /api/cos/agents)
6. Check Claude Code changelog for new releases (GET /api/cos/claude-changelog). If there are newEntries, include a "Claude Code Updates" section listing each new version with a brief summary. Link to the release page for details.
7. Suggest 2-3 focus areas for today based on open tasks and recent activity
8. For each agent-actionable focus area (coding tasks, GitHub maintenance, system fixes — NOT personal activities), create a CoS task via POST /api/cos/tasks if no equivalent task already exists in the pending tasks from steps 1-2. Use type "internal", appropriate priority, and include context about why it was flagged.

Write the briefing in a concise, actionable format. Save it as a CoS report. Note which tasks were created.`,

4. For each DataDog-enabled app:
   - Call POST /api/datadog/instances/:instanceId/search-errors with serviceName, environment, and fromTime (24h ago)
   - Compare results against the error cache in /data/cos/datadog-errors.json
   - Identify new errors (by fingerprint/message hash)

Phase 3 — File Issues and Queue Fixes:
5. For each genuinely new error:
   - Update the error cache with the new fingerprint (always, regardless of JIRA config)
   - If app has jira.enabled = true AND jira.instanceId AND jira.projectKey are set:
     Create a JIRA ticket with labels ["datadog-auto", "cos-detected"]:
     POST /api/jira/instances/:instanceId/tickets with projectKey, summary, description, issueType: "Bug", labels

     POST /api/cos/tasks with type: "internal", useWorktree: true, openPR: true, the error stack trace, JIRA ticket reference (if created), and instructions to implement fix + open PR

Phase 4 — Report:
6. Generate a summary report covering:

   - New errors vs already-known errors
   - JIRA tickets created

You are acting as my Chief of Staff, performing a weekly health check on my LLM Wiki.

The wiki lives in an Obsidian vault. Read the schema file first:
  Read the file at: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/PortOS/WIKI.md

Then perform a full lint pass:

1. Read wiki/index.md and wiki/log.md to understand current state
2. Read every file in wiki/ (sources, entities, concepts, comparisons, synthesis, queries)
3. Read every file in raw/ to check for unprocessed sources
4. Check for:
   - Contradictions between wiki pages (conflicting claims about the same topic)
   - Orphan pages with no inbound wikilinks from other pages
   - Concepts or entities mentioned repeatedly in text but lacking their own dedicated page
   - Claims that appear outdated based on newer files in raw/
   - Missing cross-references (pages that should link to each other but don't)
   - Raw sources that have no corresponding wiki/sources/ summary page
   - Broken wikilinks (links to pages that don't exist)
   - Frontmatter inconsistencies (missing type, dates, sources, tags)
5. Write the health report to wiki/lint-report.md with:
   - Summary of findings grouped by severity (critical, warning, suggestion)
   - Specific fixes for each issue (which file, what to change)
   - Statistics (total pages, total links, orphan count, coverage %)
6. Append a log entry to wiki/log.md
7. Create CoS tasks for any critical issues that need manual attention

Focus on actionable findings. The goal is to keep the wiki healthy as it grows.`,
