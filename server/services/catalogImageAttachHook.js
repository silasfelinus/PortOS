/**
 * Catalog image-attach hook (issue #1359).
 *
 * Subscribes to mediaJobEvents and, for each completed image job that carries
 * `params.catalogAttach.ingredientId`, attaches the rendered filename onto that
 * catalog ingredient — server-side, independent of any mounted client. This is
 * the durable counterpart to CatalogIngredient.jsx's mounted `onFilename`
 * callback: a long-running local/Codex render that completes after the user has
 * navigated away, refreshed, or switched ingredients still lands a portrait or
 * reference row (previously the image reached the media library but no row was
 * ever created, so the attachment was silently lost).
 *
 * Decision mirrors the client's optimistic path (`handleGeneratedImage`): the
 * first image becomes the portrait, later ones attach as references — unless an
 * explicit `kind` was requested. Idempotent against the client path: when the
 * filename is already attached (the still-mounted client won the race), the hook
 * is a no-op, so the same render never lands as both portrait AND reference.
 *
 * Mounted once at server boot from server/index.js (after the media job queue is
 * running). Best-effort: a bookkeeping miss is logged but never thrown — it must
 * not crash the server or fail the user's render.
