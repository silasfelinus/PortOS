/**
 * CoS Task Merge — claim-aware per-task LWW for cross-peer federation (#1712)
 *
 * The second half of #1650: where the completed-agent HISTORY federates as pure
 * append-only byte replication, the live task files (data/COS-TASKS.md /
 * data/TASKS.md) are the opposite — BOTH full-sync peers mutate them, and each
 * task carries claim/lease metadata (`claimedBy`/`claimedAt`/`leaseExpiresAt`
 * from #1563). A naive whole-file last-writer-wins would clobber a peer's fresh
 * claim and re-introduce the exact double-spawn hazard the lease exists to
 * prevent. So a peer's task list is merged into the local one per task, not
 * copied over it.
 *
 * Pure + side-effect-free: `mergeTaskLists(local, remote, { now })` takes two
 * arrays of parsed tasks (taskParser.parseTasksMarkdown shape) and returns the
 * merged array. Persistence + the wire fetch live in the callers
 * (cosTaskStore.mergePeerTasks, peerSync.syncCosTasksFromPeer).
 *
 * Merge rules (run identically on BOTH peers so they converge to the same
 * result regardless of which side initiates the sweep):
 *
 *  1. Union by id. A task present on only one side is kept as-is — that's how
 *     each peer learns the other's backlog. (Deletes do NOT propagate, matching
 *     PortOS's LWW-per-id model everywhere else — a task is "removed" by moving
 *     it to `completed`, never by dropping the line; an omitted id would just
 *     resurrect from the peer on the next sweep. See cosTaskStore.deleteTask.)
 *
 *  2. For a task on BOTH sides, choose the CONTENT by lifecycle rank: a task
 *     only ever advances pending → in_progress → (completed|blocked), so the
 *     higher-ranked status is the newer truth and wins. This makes completion
 *     converge: once either peer marks a task done, the other adopts it instead
 *     of holding it `in_progress` forever (a live claim alone can't carry that
 *     signal — the owner strips the claim when it completes).
 *
 *  3. Resolve the CLAIM metadata independently of content via the live lease:
 *     a side holding an unexpired lease is authoritative (the other peer must
 *     see that claim so its spawn guard yields). If BOTH hold a live lease (the
 *     sub-second claim race the lease only narrows, never eliminates), break the
 *     tie deterministically — later `leaseExpiresAt`, then smaller `claimedBy` —
 *     so both peers pick the SAME owner and the loser yields on its next spawn
 *     guard. A claim is never kept on a terminal (completed/blocked) task —
 *     that mirrors cosTaskStore's release-on-transition so a finished task is
 *     freely re-claimable.

 * higher priority, then lexicographically-greater description, then a stable
 * JSON tiebreak on the remaining comparable fields.
 *
 * NOTE: with no per-task edit timestamp this converges but cannot guarantee
 * *newest-edit* wins (it can prefer a stale higher-priority value over a fresh
 * lower one). That's the conventional LWW trade-off; a real `updatedAt` edit
 * key is the proper upgrade (tracked in #1714). Convergence is the
 * load-bearing property here — a sync that never reconciles is worse.
