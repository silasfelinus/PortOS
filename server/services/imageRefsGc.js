/**
 * Staged-upload image-refs GC (issue #1214)
 *
 * Init/reference uploads for i2i / edit renders are staged into
 * `data/image-refs` with a fresh UUID name (`init-<uuid>.png` / `ref-<uuid>.png`)
 * on EVERY render (`imageGen/prepareParams.js`). They are never cleaned up, so
 * `data/image-refs` grows without bound for any user who does repeated
 * edit-from-upload renders. (Migration 085 relocated these out of the gallery
 * dir, fixing the visible duplicate-card bug, but the unbounded accumulation
 * was left silent rather than solved.)
 *
 * This periodic sweep deletes `init-`/`ref-`-prefixed files in `data/image-refs`
 * that are BOTH:
 *   (a) not referenced by any gallery sidecar's `initImageFilename` /
 *       `referenceImageFilenames` basenames, AND
 *   (b) older than a grace window.
 *
 * Why BOTH gates (not either):
 * - The reference check alone is unsafe — the codex backend does NOT record an
 *   `initImageFilename` in its sidecar, so a still-wanted init upload behind a
 *   codex render would look unreferenced. The age gate is the backstop: a file
 *   younger than the window is spared regardless, covering codex lineage and
 *   renders still in flight (the staged file exists before its sidecar is
 *   written).
 * - The age check alone is unsafe — a long-lived gallery image that still
 *   points at an old init upload would lose its lineage source. The reference
 *   check protects those: any basename a kept sidecar names is never swept,
 *   no matter how old.
 *
 * Conservative by construction: only the `init-<uuid>` / `ref-<uuid>` staged
 * pattern is a candidate (the same discriminator migration 085 uses). Character
 * reference sheets (`universe-…`, `sheet-…`) and any other file in the dir are
 * never matched.
 *
 * Runs OUTSIDE the Express request lifecycle (a `setInterval` from index.js),
 * so this module wraps its sweep in try/catch and logs single-line per the repo
 * logging convention — an uncaught throw here would crash the process.
