/**
 * Importer Orphan-Shell GC (issue #727)
 *
 * `analyzeImport` creates a brand-new universe + series shell so the analyze
 * preview has stable ids the client can commit/retry against. When the user
 * abandons the import before committing (e.g. an issue-split failure on a
 * fresh universe/series), those shells linger on disk forever.
 *
 * The primary defense is marking analyze-created shells `ephemeral` (kept out
 * of every sync transport) and clearing the flag in `commitImport` once the
 * import lands. This sweep is the belt-and-suspenders second half: it deletes
 * shells that are STILL ephemeral, hold no committed work (zero issues,
 * zero canon entities, no arc/seasons), and are older than a grace window —
 * so an abandoned analyze self-cleans instead of accreting orphan data.
 *
 * Conservative by construction:
 * - Only `ephemeral` records are candidates. A committed import promotes both
 *   records out of ephemeral, so a real universe/series is never a candidate
 *   regardless of how empty it looks.
 * - A universe is only swept once its ephemeral series are gone AND it has no
 *   OTHER live (non-deleted) series — so a shared universe is never removed as
 *   a side-effect. `deleteUniverse` also enforces this block-until-empty rule.
 * - The age gate is measured from `updatedAt` (the most recent touch), so a
 *   user mid-flight on a fresh analyze is never swept out from under them.
 *
 * Runs OUTSIDE the Express request lifecycle (a `setInterval` from index.js),
 * so this module wraps its sweep in try/catch and logs single-line per the
 * repo logging convention — an uncaught throw here would crash the process.
