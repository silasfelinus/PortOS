/**
 * Checkpoint inspection + selection for trained LoRAs.
 *
 * A training run keeps every periodic checkpoint, but only one adapter is
 * registered into `data/loras/` as the usable LoRA. mflux always hands back
 * the FINAL step's adapter — which is exactly wrong when training diverges
 * late (a recurring FLUX.2 failure: the loss keeps dropping while the sample
 * image collapses to a near-black frame). Loss is therefore NOT a reliable
 * "best checkpoint" signal — it was anti-correlated with quality on the run
 * that motivated this module. So selection is two-pronged:
 *
 *   1. A cheap COLLAPSE GUARD at finalize that only vetoes the catastrophic
 *      case — a degenerate (near-black / near-uniform) final preview — and
 *      falls back to the latest non-degenerate checkpoint.
 *   2. A MANUAL promote path (`promoteCheckpoint`) so the human can pick any
 *      checkpoint by eye from its preview thumbnail — the real safety net for
 *      subtler degradation the guard intentionally leaves alone.
 *
 * Runtime-aware: mflux checkpoints are `*_checkpoint.zip` bundles (the
 * adapter is cracked out with lib/zipStream); the torch flux2 trainer writes
 * `checkpoints/step-NNNNNN/pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors` directories.
