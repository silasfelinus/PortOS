/**
 * Pipeline — auto-file series/volume/issue cover renders into either the
 * series' universe collection (when the series is universe-linked) or a
 * per-series collection (fallback for series without a universe).
 *
 * The Universe Builder already maintains a `Universe: <name>` collection per
 * universe (`server/services/universeBuilderCollectionHook.js` files render
 * jobs into it by tag). Pipeline cover renders bypass that hook — they go
 * through dedicated routes that don't carry a `universeRun` tag — so without
 * this helper, a series/volume/issue cover image renders into the gallery
 * but never lands in any collection. Without a collection to bundle, the
 * share-bucket exporter has nothing to put in `manifest.collection` either.
 *
 * The two cover filename hooks (seasonCover, comicPages cover/backCover)
 * call `fileCoverIntoAutoCollection` after they finish stamping the
 * filename on the stage record. Failures are logged and swallowed —
 * bookkeeping must never fail the user's render.
 *
 * **Concurrency.** No per-universe/per-series queue is needed here. Every
 * collection write routes through the single file-level write tail in
 * `mediaCollections.js`. Two parallel filings for the same series (cover +
 * back-cover from the same render burst) interleave their own `await`
 * points freely; the file tail serializes the *writes* so both filenames
 * land and neither orphans the collection.
