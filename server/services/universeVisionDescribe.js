/**
 * Universe Builder — vision-to-prose describer.
 *
 * Takes one or more reference images of a character / place / object and asks
 * a vision-capable model to turn them into an image-gen-ready prose
 * description that can seed the canon entry's descriptor field.
 *
 * Single image → describe that subject. Multiple images → find the visual
 * traits CONSISTENT across all of them (the same character shot from several
 * angles, a location across lighting conditions, a prop in different hands) and
 * describe that shared subject, ignoring incidental differences.
 *
 * Vision is an API-provider-only capability: the toolkit's executeApiRun is the
 * only runner path that base64-encodes images into `image_url` content blocks
 * (CLI/TUI providers receive prompts via stdin only). So we resolve an
 * API-type provider up front and throw NO_API_PROVIDER when none is configured,
 * rather than silently running a text-only completion that hallucinates a
 * description from nothing.
