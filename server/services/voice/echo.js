// Detect when an inbound voice transcript is actually the bot's own TTS being
// picked up by the user's microphone (laptop speakers + built-in mic, no
// headphones). Without this, the bot replies to its own speech and runs in a
// feedback loop until the user manually stops it.
//
// A mirror of this algorithm runs client-side in
// client/src/services/voiceClient.js for the Web Speech STT path (which
// produces transcripts in-browser and never sends audio to the server).
// KEEP THE TWO IN SYNC — same tokenizer, same thresholds, same window.
//
// Strategy — two stacked filters:
//   1. Length gate: utterances shorter than MIN_TOKENS_FOR_ECHO_CHECK words
//      are NEVER classified as echo. Barge-ins are typically short
//      ("wait", "stop", "actually no") while echoes are full sentences.
//      This single rule preserves user interrupts even when their words also
//      appear in TTS.
//   2. Trigram match: for longer utterances, share-counting against the
//      trigrams of recently-spoken TTS sentences. Two contiguous 3-word
//      windows aligning is strong evidence — coincidental overlap on common
//      words rarely produces multiple shared trigrams.
//
// Time-windowed: TTS sentences older than `windowMs` are ignored so an echo
// from 30 seconds ago can't suppress a legitimate later utterance.
