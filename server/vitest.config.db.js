/**
 * DB-backed test config — runs ONLY the suites that talk to a real Postgres
 * (the `*.db.test.js` adapter round-trips + a few catalog/migration suites),
 * against the throwaway `portos_test` database.
 *
 * Why a separate config:
 *  - These suites `DELETE FROM` / truncate whole tables in setup. The default
 *    runner parallelizes test FILES, so two of them hitting the same table in
 *    one shared database would clobber each other. `fileParallelism: false`
 *    runs them one file at a time — correct, and they're fast.
 *  - `env.PGDATABASE = portos_test` points them at the test DB. isTestDatabase()
 *    recognizes the `_test` suffix, so checkHealth() lets them connect and run
 *    (against the real `portos` DB they would skip — that's the safety guard).
 *
 * The default `vitest.config.js` ALSO matches these files, but there they skip
 * (PGDATABASE is unset → resolves to non-test `portos`). So `npm test` never
 * runs them; `npm run test:db` does, after `npm run setup:db:test`.
 *
 * Adding a new DB-backed test? If it's named `*.db.test.js` it's auto-included.
 * Otherwise add it to `include` below — db.guards.test.js fails if a checkHealth
 * consumer is left out.
